# Sandbox Feedback Loop — Training mode builds agents (list_connections / get_connection / create_agent)

Adds three **training-mode-only** AI tools so one prompt can go from "what can I
build on?" to a ready agent:

- `list_connections` — the org connections the caller can build a NEW agent on
  (create tier only: org `create_data_source` + per-connection
  `create_data_sources`), summary-only.
- `get_connection` — ONE connection's catalog *before any agent exists*: tables
  grouped by schema, tools (MCP/API), or the file scope + indexed files
  (network_dir/S3/drive), with case-insensitive **glob** filtering and
  **pagination**.
- `create_agent` — create the agent on existing connection(s) with optional
  inline selection (`schemas` / `tables` globs / `tools` globs), attach it to
  the training session, and report any unmatched selector explicitly.

Design: `docs/design/training-mode-connections-and-agent-creation.md`.

---

## Decisions baked in

1. **No credentials through the LLM.** `create_agent` only links existing
   connections (Mode 2 of `DataSourceService.create_data_source`); the inline
   connection-creation path and `POST /connections` are never exposed as tools.
2. **Permission pair enforced in the tool layer** (route decorators don't cover
   the AI tool path): org `create_data_source` AND per-connection
   `create_data_sources` (implied by connection `manage_data_sources`, org
   `manage_connections`, or full admin) — exactly what `POST /data_sources`
   requires. `list_connections`/`get_connection` are visibility-scoped by the
   same tier.
3. **Selection only ever targets the just-created agent** — there are no
   standalone table/tool mutation tools. Post-create refinement is UI
   (`TablesSelector`/`ToolsSelector` from the agent page; the tool card links
   there).
4. **Report attach on create**: the new agent joins `report.data_sources`, so
   `create_instruction`/`create_prompt` scope to it immediately (their
   `allowed_data_source_ids` guard reads the report at call time), and the
   per-session RBAC memo is invalidated so the creator's fresh `manage` grant
   is visible to later tool calls in the same run
   (`permission_resolver.invalidate_rbac_memo`).
5. **A selection that matches nothing keeps the seeded defaults** and every
   unmatched selector is returned in `unresolved` — never silently dropped,
   never an agent nuked to zero tables.

## What changed (the feature)

Tool schemas — `backend/app/ai/tools/schemas/`:
`list_connections.py`, `get_connection.py`, `create_agent.py`.

Tool implementations — `backend/app/ai/tools/implementations/`:
- `connection_catalog_common.py` — shared glob compiler (glob metachars → glob
  match; plain string → substring), registry `data_shape` lookup, file-scope
  descriptor (root/bucket + `include_globs` + `index_mode`, token-scoped for
  OneDrive/GDrive/Outlook), and the permission-tier helpers.
- `list_connections.py` — `category="research"`, `allowed_modes=["training"]`.
- `get_connection.py` — `category="research"`, `allowed_modes=["training"]`;
  tables/objects → schema-grouped names + column/row counts (columns JSON
  fetched only for the page); tools → name/description/default policy; files →
  scope + indexed file rows. Glob + `schema_name` + `page`/`page_size`.
- `create_agent.py` — `category="action"`, `allowed_modes=["training"]`.

Also: `permission_resolver.invalidate_rbac_memo` (drops the per-session memo
entry after the create grants `manage`), planner training block routing
(`prompt_builder_v3.py`), three tool cards
(`ListConnectionsTool.vue`, `GetConnectionTool.vue`, `CreateAgentTool.vue` —
agent card with status/description and Tables/Tools/Files tabs fed by
`full_schema` / `/tools` / per-connection files), registration in
`reports/[id]/index.vue`, i18n keys in all ten locale catalogs.

Gating is entirely `allowed_modes=["training"]` + the registry mode filter — no
agent_v2 change.

---

## Loop A — registry gating (no DB, no LLM)

```bash
cd backend
export BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/app.db"
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from app.ai.registry import ToolRegistry
r = ToolRegistry()
for mode in ("training", "chat", "deep", "knowledge"):
    names = set()
    for pt in ("action", "research"):
        names |= {t["name"] for t in r.get_catalog_for_plan_type(pt, mode=mode)}
    print(mode, "->", sorted(n for n in names if n in ("list_connections", "get_connection", "create_agent")))
PY
```

**Observed (PASS):**
```
training  -> ['create_agent', 'get_connection', 'list_connections']
chat      -> []
deep      -> []
knowledge -> []
```
(`knowledge` matters: the auto-suggest harness must never create agents.)

---

## Loop B — tool behavior + create-tier RBAC (DB, no LLM)

Drives all three tools through `run_stream` against the real
`DataSourceService` and permission resolver. World: `creator` (custom role with
org `create_data_source` + a `create_data_sources` grant on `conn_main` only),
`member` (plain member), `admin` (full admin); a postgres-shaped connection
with 4 tables across 2 schemas, a second ungranted connection, an `mcp`
connection with 3 tools; a training report.

```bash
cd backend
TESTING=true BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/app.db" BOW_SMTP_PASSWORD=dummy \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/training/test_connection_agent_tools.py -v
```

**Asserts (all PASS — 8 passed):**
- `list_connections`: creator sees exactly the granted connection (schemas +
  counts correct); admin sees all incl. the tools-shaped one; plain member gets
  an empty list; glob `search` narrows.
- `get_connection`: schema grouping + column/row counts; `schema_name` filter;
  glob patterns (`s*s`, substring); pagination (`has_more` flips); ungranted
  connection → `permission_denied` (no metadata leak).
- `create_agent` + `schemas=["Sales"]` (case-insensitive): 2/4 tables active,
  DB truth matches, agent attached to the report, creator resolves
  `manage_instructions` on it (memo invalidation), duplicate name →
  `name_taken`.
- Permission gates: plain member → `permission_denied`; creator on an
  ungranted connection → `permission_denied`; unknown id →
  `connection_not_found`; nothing created by denied calls.
- Unmatched selection (`schemas=["nonexistent_schema"], tables=["bogus_*"]`) →
  created with seeded defaults kept, both selectors in `unresolved`.
- Tool selection on the mcp connection (`tools=["get_*","list_*"]`) → 2/3
  enabled; overlay rows show `send_message` disabled.

**Regression (unchanged):** `tests/e2e/rbac/test_rbac_data_sources.py`,
`test_rbac_training_mode.py`, `test_rbac_connections.py`,
`tests/prompts/test_prompt_training_tools.py`,
`tests/unit/test_permission_resolver.py` — all pass.

## Loop C — live UI + LLM (training mode, Haiku)

Full stack (`python main.py` + `yarn dev`), Anthropic provider configured from
the `ANTHROPIC_KEY` env var (never committed), chinook + stocks demos
installed, a report on the Music Store agent switched to **Training**. Driver:
three real completions.

1. *"What connections can I build a new agent on?"* → planner calls
   `list_connections` → card lists **Finance DuckDB** (17 tables) and **SQLite
   Chinook** (11 tables) with linked agents.

   ![list_connections card](assets/training-connections-agent/01_list_connections_card.png)

2. *"What tables does the SQLite Chinook connection have? Show me the invoice
   ones."* → `get_connection(pattern='*invoice*')` → card: "Inspected SQLite
   Chinook · 2 matching" (Invoice 9 cols, InvoiceLine 5 cols).

   ![get_connection card](assets/training-connections-agent/02_get_connection_card.png)

3. *"Create a new agent on the SQLite Chinook connection named 'Invoice
   Analytics' with only the invoice tables active."* → the model passed
   `tables=["Invoice","InvoiceLine"]` and the tool returned
   `{success: true, tables_total: 11, tables_active: 2, active_table_sample:
   ["Invoice","InvoiceLine"], attached_to_report: true, unresolved: []}`.
   The card shows the agent with **Active/Private** badges, the description,
   the Tables tab at **2/11** (green dots on the invoice tables), and the
   "Open agent" link.

   ![create_agent card](assets/training-connections-agent/03_create_agent_card.png)

4. *"Using the Invoice Analytics agent, what is the total invoice revenue?"*
   (next turn, same session) → `create_data` runs against the **newly created
   agent** and answers **$2,328.60** — the correct Chinook invoice total. This
   proves the create→attach→query lifecycle: clients for the new agent are
   built on the next run, exactly as the tool's observation states.


### Scale + tools variant (embedded selectors)

The agent card embeds the REAL `TablesSelector` / `ToolsSelector` in its tabs
(a `show-header` prop was added to `ToolsSelector` for compact embedding), so a
huge catalog stays navigable and editable right in the chat:

- **Big Warehouse** (seeded: 2,400 tables across 7 schemas) → *"Create a new
  agent … named 'Finance Mart' with only the finance schema active"* →
  `create_agent(schemas=["finance"])` returned `tables_total: 2400,
  tables_active: 180`. The card's Tables tab shows the full selector —
  "Showing 1-15 of 2400", "180/2400 active", server-side search
  (`fin_table_00` → "100 matching"), schema filter, sort, pagination, bulk
  select, Save.

  ![scale tables selector](assets/training-connections-agent/06_scale_tables_selector.png)
  ![scale tables search](assets/training-connections-agent/07_scale_tables_search.png)

- **Ops Tools (MCP)** (seeded: 20 tools with allow/confirm/deny defaults) →
  *"…named 'Ops Assistant' with only the read tools enabled"* → the model
  enumerated the get/list/search tools and `create_agent(tools=[…])` returned
  `tools_total: 20, tools_enabled: 12`. The card's Tools tab is the live
  per-agent overlay editor: filter, per-tool enable checkboxes, admin policy
  dropdowns, reset-to-default, and the user's own policy column.

  ![tools selector card](assets/training-connections-agent/08_tools_selector_card.png)

  Note (seed artifact): a connection with an *invalid config* attached to a
  report makes the next turn's client construction 500
  (`PostgresqlClient.__init__` missing args) — pre-existing behavior for any
  broken connection on a report, hit here only because the seeded demo
  connection initially had an empty config.

**DB/API truth after the run:**
```
active tables of the new agent: ['Invoice', 'InvoiceLine']   (all others inactive)
report agents: ['Music Store', 'Invoice Analytics']          (attached mid-session)
```

The new agent on the Agents page and its detail view (Private, SQLite Chinook,
2 tables / 0 tools / 0 files, description carried over):

### v2 — API-real demo + collapsed card (current design)

Reran the whole loop with NOTHING seeded by hand: a **DuckDB file with 6,000
tables** registered via `POST /connections` and discovered by the real indexer,
and a **live MCP server** (`mcp.server.fastmcp`, streamable-http) whose 13 tools
were discovered via `POST /connections/{id}/refresh-tools`. A fresh training
session then ran four real turns: create **Finance Mart**
(`tables=["finance_*"]` → 900/6000 active), create **Ops Assistant** (8/13 read
tools), `create_instruction` (staged → approved via `/builds/{id}/publish`),
`create_eval` (case created for Finance Mart).

The agent card is now **collapsed by default**: section chips — Tables / Tools /
Files / Instructions / Evals — expand on click and close on a second click,
gated by permissions (`view_schema` for catalog sections, `manage_evals` for
evals, server-scoped fetch for instructions). Sections embed the real
`TablesSelector`, `ToolsSelector` (new `show-header` prop), and
`AgentEvalsPanel`. `get_connection` results also collapse behind a
"Show N results" toggle — a model-requested 100-row page no longer floods the
conversation.

![collapsed card](assets/training-connections-agent/10_card_collapsed.png)
![tables expanded over 6000](assets/training-connections-agent/11_tables_expanded_6000.png)
![instructions expanded](assets/training-connections-agent/12_instructions_expanded.png)
![evals expanded](assets/training-connections-agent/13_evals_expanded.png)
![ops tools expanded](assets/training-connections-agent/14_ops_tools_expanded.png)

**Bugs found and fixed by this loop:**

1. **Agents with tool overlays couldn't be deleted** — `session.delete(DataSource)`
   NULLed `data_source_connection_tool.data_source_id` (NOT NULL violation)
   because the overlay relationships had no ORM cascade and SQLite doesn't
   enforce the DDL `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Both backrefs now cascade ORM-side;
   regression: `test_agent_with_tool_overlays_can_be_deleted`.
2. **Agent-run failures were untraceable** — `completion_service` reported
   `Agent execution failed: {str(e)}` where `str(e)` can be empty (the live
   loop hit `cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken` — invisible). The handler now
   logs the traceback.

**Sandbox lesson (not a code change):** without `BOW_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, the
Fernet key is generated per process, so a backend restart orphans every stored
credential (LLM provider keys decode as `InvalidToken`). Pin the env var in
`backend/.env` before storing credentials in a dev sandbox.


### v3 — guided (interactive) agent creation

"Create an agent on X" with no coverage stated is now a conversation, not a
guess. Two layers:

- **Guardrail (deterministic):** `create_agent` on a tables catalog over 25
  tables (or a tool set over 15) with no `schemas`/`tables`/`tools` and no
  `use_defaults` returns `rejected_reason="needs_selection"` with
  `selection_groups` — schema names + counts, name-prefix globs for schemaless
  catalogs (DuckDB/SQLite), or tool verb-prefix globs — and creates nothing.
  The observation tells the planner to offer exactly those groups via the
  clarify tool's clickable options (plus "Everything" → `use_defaults=true`).
  The offered globs are valid create_agent inputs as-is.
- **Interview protocol (planner prompt):** the training block instructs a
  friendly one-line plan → `get_connection` → `clarify` with chips (+ name
  question when missing) → `create_agent` with the mapped choice; fully
  specified requests skip the interview. The card renders `needs_selection`
  as a neutral "Which data should this agent cover?" state with the group
  chips, not as a failure.

Loop B additions (all PASS — 12 passed):
- Large catalog, no selection → `needs_selection` with `{sales: 20, analytics: 10}`,
  nothing created; `use_defaults=true` → created; small catalog (4 tables) →
  created directly with no interview.
- Schemaless catalog → prefix groups `{fin_*: 18, ops_*: 12}` and the offered
  glob works verbatim on retry (18 active); 16-tool MCP connection → verb
  groups `{get_*: 10, send_*: 6}`, retry with `tools=["get_*"]` → 10 enabled.

Live LLM leg: blocked at the time of writing — the sandbox Anthropic key ran
out of credits mid-loop ("credit balance is too low"); the failed request
payload confirms the interview block ships in the planner system prompt.
Re-run the Loop C prompts ("Create an agent on Big Warehouse called 'Sales
Hub'", answer a chip) once a funded key is configured.

## What this proves

- The three tools exist **only** in training mode (Loop A), enforce the same
  create tier as `POST /data_sources` **inside the tool layer** (Loop B), and
  a single natural-language prompt produces a correctly-scoped, session-attached
  agent through a real model end-to-end (Loop C).
- Glob + schema filtering and pagination work on the pre-create catalog view,
  including the file-scope descriptor path for file-shaped connections.
- Unmatched selections are surfaced, not silently dropped; denied calls create
  nothing.

## Regression notes

- The locale catalogs had pre-existing key drift (es/he missing ~203 keys,
  fr/sv/ar/ru/de/pt/it ~300 vs en on main); the 35 new keys were added to all
  ten catalogs and the pre-existing drift was left untouched.
- A pre-existing `_persist_completion_score_with_retry` traceback appears in
  the live-run backend log (score persistence retry, `agent_v2.py:952`);
  it reproduces without these changes and does not affect the turns.
