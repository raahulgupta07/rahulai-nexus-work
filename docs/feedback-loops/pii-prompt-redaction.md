# Feedback Loop — "add PII block/replace for prompts sent to the LLM"

Redact personal data (PII) from prompts **before** they are sent to any LLM
provider, with prebuilt + custom regex rules (a rule may hold several patterns),
a replace-with-token mode and a hard block mode. The feature is **enterprise-
gated** (`pii_protection`) and must not activate on a community build. This loop
validates the redaction engine, the LLM chokepoint wiring, the license gate, and
the settings UI end-to-end.

## What was built (file:line)

- Rule engine: `backend/app/ai/llm/pii/redactor.py` — compile, `scan`, `apply`
  (replace + block), no-raw-values audit summary; `validate_pattern` for save-time
  regex validation.
- Prebuilt rules: `backend/app/ai/llm/pii/builtin_rules.py` — email, credit card,
  US SSN, phone, IPv4, IBAN, AWS key (each with one or more patterns).
- Per-org loader + cache with the **enterprise gate**:
  `backend/app/ai/llm/pii/loader.py:load_redactor_for_org` (returns `None` unless
  `has_feature("pii_protection")`).
- LLM chokepoint: `backend/app/ai/llm/llm.py` — redaction applied in `inference`
  (`llm.py:270`), `inference_stream` (`:335`) and `inference_stream_v2` (`:452`,
  via `_apply_pii_v2`). Loaded lazily from `model.organization_id`, so it is
  on-by-construction at all ~29 `LLM(...)` call sites.
- License tier: `backend/app/ee/license.py` — `pii_protection` added to the
  `enterprise` tier.
- Config schema: `backend/app/schemas/organization_settings_schema.py`
  (`PiiRule`, `PiiProtectionConfig`); validation + cache invalidation in
  `backend/app/services/organization_settings_service.py`.
- API: `backend/app/routes/organization_settings.py` — builtin-rule catalogue +
  dry-run `/organization/pii/test`.
- UI: `frontend/pages/settings/pii.vue` + tab gating in
  `frontend/layouts/settings.vue` (hidden unless `hasFeature('pii_protection')`).

## Root cause / design (validated)

The single place every agent reaches a provider is the `LLM` class
(`backend/app/ai/llm/llm.py`) — planner, coder, judge, answer, tools all go
through `inference*`. Redacting there covers the *entire assembled prompt*
(user message + schema samples + data previews + uploaded file text) by
construction. Because a missed call site on a privacy control is a silent leak,
the redactor is resolved *inside* `LLM` from `model.organization_id` (cached,
enterprise-gated) rather than threaded through every constructor.

## Loop A — deterministic reproduction (no external services)

Pure-logic + API/DB, LLM provider stubbed. Runs in a clean sandbox on SQLite.

```bash
cd backend
export TESTING=true BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/app.db" TEST_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/agenttest.db"
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_pii_redactor.py tests/e2e/test_pii_protection.py -q --db=sqlite
```

Observed: **26 passed**. Key assertions:

- `tests/e2e/test_pii_protection.py::test_inference_redacts_before_reaching_provider`
  — a prompt with `john@acme.com` / `415-555-1234` reaches a stub client with the
  PII already replaced (proves the chokepoint redacts before the provider call).
- `test_inference_stream_v2_block_mode_refuses` — block mode raises
  `PiiPromptBlockedError` before any provider call on the native tool-use path.
- `test_pii_write_refused_without_license` — PUT returns **402** when
  `has_feature` is False.
- `test_redactor_loader_is_enterprise_gated` — with an **enabled** config
  persisted, `load_redactor_for_org` returns a live redactor when licensed and
  **None** on a community instance. This is the guarantee the feature can't
  activate without a license.

To prove the loop can fail: stash the redaction call in `LLM.inference`
(`prompt = self._apply_pii(...)`) and `test_inference_redacts_before_reaching_provider`
fails because the raw email reaches the stub.

## Loop B — live UI end-to-end (Playwright, seeded stack)

```bash
# Enterprise: boot WITH the license key
BOW_LICENSE_KEY=... tools/agent/boot_stack.sh --dev
cd backend && BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/agent.db" uv run python ../tools/agent/seed_org.py --demo
# then drive frontend/pii_e2e.mjs  (login, enable, add multi-pattern rule, preview)
```

Observed (licensed): PII tab visible, master toggle + Replace/Block modes,
7 built-in rules, a custom "Employee ID" rule with two patterns
(`EMP-\d{4}`, `E\d{6}`). Live preview of
`Email john.doe@acme.com, call 415-555-1234, SSN 078-05-1120, badge EMP-4821 and E123456.`
→ `Email [REDACTED_EMAIL], call [REDACTED_PHONE], SSN [REDACTED_SSN], badge [EMPLOYEE_ID] and [EMPLOYEE_ID].`
(Matched: Email 1, SSN 1, Phone 1, Employee ID 2 — both custom patterns fired.)

Community leg: reboot the stack **without** `BOW_LICENSE_KEY`. Observed: the PII
tab is absent from `/settings`, `/settings/pii` shows the "Enterprise feature"
gate (no toggles), and `PUT /api/organization/settings` for `pii_protection`
returns **402**.

Screenshots: `media/pr/pii-block-replace-llm/`.

## Display-layer redaction (PII masked in the rendered UI)

Beyond redacting what the LLM sees, PII is also masked in content served to the
frontend so it never appears in the rendered UI — the chat prompt/message *and*
the table/widget cells — while the stored data stays real (compute, `load_step`,
and exports keep operating on real values).

- Engine: `redactor.redact_display` / `redact_grid` / `redact_deep`
  (`backend/app/ai/llm/pii/redactor.py`) mask string cells + nested
  `info`/`stats` for display.
- Request scoping: `backend/app/ai/llm/pii/display.py` holds a request-scoped
  redactor in a `ContextVar`; `main.py`'s `pii_display_redaction_middleware`
  sets it per request from the org header (enterprise-gated, cached, no-op when
  disabled).
- Single catch-all: `StepSchema.data` has a `@field_serializer`
  (`backend/app/schemas/step_schema.py`) that masks on serialization only — so
  every funnel that emits a step (completions, `/steps/{id}`, widgets,
  `/queries/*`, report summary) is covered without per-route wiring, while
  internal `.data` access stays real.
- Text/observation funnels not covered by the step serializer are masked
  explicitly: completion `prompt`/block text (`completion_service.py`,
  `serializers/completion_v2.py`) and tool `result_json`
  (`completion_v2.py`, `report_service.py:get_report_summary`).

Live verification (Haiku 4.5, Music Store demo): a report where the user typed
"My SSN is 078-05-1120 and phone 415-555-9999. List 15 customers…" renders the
message as "My SSN is `[REDACTED_SSN]` and phone `[REDACTED_PHONE]`" and the
customers table's Email column as `[REDACTED_EMAIL]` on every row (First/Last
name and Country unchanged). A network sweep confirms **no** endpoint returns a
raw customer email. Screenshots: `media/pr/pii-block-replace-llm/09-ui-*`,
`10-ui-*`.

## What this proves

- PII is redacted from the full outbound prompt at the one chokepoint every
  agent shares, in both replace and block modes.
- One rule can carry multiple regex patterns; prebuilt and custom rules compose.
- The feature is strictly enterprise-gated — inactive and refused on community,
  active only under a valid enterprise license — verified via API, the loader,
  and the UI.
