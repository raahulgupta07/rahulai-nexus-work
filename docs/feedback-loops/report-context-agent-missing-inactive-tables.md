# Feedback Loop — "the report does not have the right context, even though the prompt box has it"

An agent (data source) is selected in the prompt box and attached to the report,
its connection is live, the user is an **admin** — yet the model answers that it
is connected to *fewer* data sources than are attached, silently omitting one or
more. Mentioning the missing agent with `@` makes it work. This loop reproduces
the failure end-to-end (deterministic + real-LLM + UI) and pins **two** root
causes that share one defect in `render_combined`.

**Status: FIXED** — `render_combined` now renders `file_scopes` and keeps a data
source whenever any connection is live (or there is a down connection worth
flagging). See "The fix (applied)" below.

Two distinct variants share one root defect: **`render_combined` (the render the
main planner path uses, `agent_v2.py:1515`) decides source membership from
relational tables/index/MCP tools only, ignores `file_scopes`, and silently
drops any source that renders empty** (`tables_schema_section.py:582-583`).

- **Variant 1 — zero active relational tables** (below). A newly created agent,
  or any agent whose tables aren't activated, contributes 0 tables → dropped.
- **Variant 2 — file-source content** (multi-connection SQLite + network files,
  or any network_dir / s3 / sharepoint / drive agent). `render_combined` never
  renders `file_scopes`, so a source whose active content is files is dropped
  even though the files are indexed and active. See the section below —
  **this is the one that matches the "SQLite + network files" report.**

## Root cause — variant 1 (confirmed, reproduced)

**A newly created agent indexes its tables but activates none of them, and a
data source that renders zero tables is silently dropped from the agent's
schema context.** It is not connection health, not RBAC, not connector type.

1. `create_data_source` seeds the agent's tables via
   `sync_domain_tables_from_connection(max_auto_select=self.ONBOARDING_MAX_TABLES)`
   (`backend/app/services/data_source_service.py:726-729`) and
   **`ONBOARDING_MAX_TABLES = 0`** (`:3369`). With `max_auto_select == 0` the
   activation logic (`:4313-4318`) computes
   `should_activate = total_tables <= 0` → **False for every table**, and the
   smart-select fallback `if needs_smart_selection and max_auto_select:` (`:4451`)
   is skipped because `0` is falsy. The agent ends up with **0 active tables**
   (`DataSourceTable.is_active = False` for all).

2. When a completion runs, `SchemaContextBuilder.build(active_only=True)`
   (`backend/app/ai/context/builders/schema_context_builder.py:86-87`) returns
   that data source with an **empty `tables` list**.

3. `TablesSchemaContext.render_combined` then **omits the entire
   `<data_source>` element** when it renders no tables, index, or MCP tools
   (`backend/app/ai/context/sections/tables_schema_section.py:582-583`):

   ```python
   if not (sample_xml or index_xml or mcp_xml):
       continue          # the whole <data_source> is dropped from the prompt
   ```

   The model never sees the agent → "you are connected to N data sources"
   under-counts, with **no signal** that an attached agent was excluded.

`@mention` works because it routes through `MentionContextBuilder` → the
`<mentions>` section (`mentions_section.py`), which force-includes the named
source/tables and bypasses both `report.data_sources` and the `active_only`
table filter — so the model learns the table names and can query the live DB.

Why demo agents work and custom ones don't: the demo installer ships its data
sources with tables **pre-activated** (Music Store: 11/11, Financial Market
Agent: 17/17), so they always render. A freshly created custom agent starts at
0/N until a human opens its tables page and activates tables.

## Loop A — deterministic reproduction (no external services)

`backend/tests/unit/test_report_context_inactive_tables_omitted.py` pins the
render-layer omission:

```bash
cd backend
export BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/app.db"
uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/test_report_context_inactive_tables_omitted.py -p no:warnings -q
# 2 passed — an attached agent with zero active tables is absent from render_combined
```

## Loop B — full stack, real data, real LLM (reproduced)

Booted the whole app (`tools/agent/boot_stack.sh --dev`), seeded an org + admin
(`tools/agent/seed_org.py --demo`), configured Anthropic Haiku, and built three
agents across two connector types:

| Agent | Connector | Connection `is_active` | Active tables |
|---|---|---|---|
| Music Store (demo) | sqlite | 1 | **11 / 11** |
| Financial Market Agent (demo) | duckdb | 1 | **17 / 17** |
| Sales Agent (custom, admin-created) | sqlite | 1 | **0 / 11** |

A report was created attached to **all three** (`GET /api/reports/{id}` →
`data_sources: ['Sales Agent','Financial Market Agent','Music Store']`), and the
prompt box shows all three under Auto.

**Direct context check** (`SchemaContextBuilder` + `render_combined` over the real
report):

```
Attached agents:  ['Music Store', 'Financial Market Agent', 'Sales Agent']
rendered_tables:  Music Store=11   Financial Market Agent=17   Sales Agent=0
in prompt?:       Music Store=True Financial Market Agent=True Sales Agent=False
```

**Real Haiku completion** — prompt: *"List EVERY data source / agent you
currently have access to…"*:

> "You have access to **2 data sources**, both published and live: 1. Financial
> Market Agent (DuckDB) … 2. Music Store (SQLite) … There are no agents listed
> separately."

Sales Agent is absent, exactly as predicted. UI evidence:
- `assets/report-context-answer-2-of-3.png` — the answer listing only 2 of 3.
- `assets/report-context-promptbox-3-agents.png` — the prompt-box selector
  showing all 3 agents (Auto ✓; Music Store, Financial Market Agent, Sales Agent,
  all badged "Training").

**The flip** — activating Sales Agent's tables
(`POST /api/data_sources/{id}/bulk_update_tables {"action":"activate"}` → 11
activated) and rebuilding:

```
rendered_tables:  Sales Agent=11
in prompt?:       Sales Agent=True
```

The agent reappears in the context the moment its tables are active.

## Root cause — variant 2: file-source agents are invisible (matches "SQLite + network files")

A data source whose active content is **files** — a `network_dir` / `s3` /
`sharepoint` / `drive` connection, including a multi-connection agent whose
relational (SQLite) tables aren't the active content — is dropped from the
planner's schema context, and the model reports it as not connected.

`SchemaContextBuilder` pulls file-source connections out of the table pool into
`file_scopes` (`schema_context_builder.py:389`, `_build_file_scopes`). But
`render_combined` (`tables_schema_section.py:575-611`) only ever builds
`sample_xml` / `index_xml` / `mcp_xml` — it **never renders `file_scopes`** — and
then drops the whole `<data_source>` at `:582` when those are empty. The full
`render("full")` DOES emit file scopes (`:346-348`) and never skips a source,
which is why the same agent is visible via `@mention` and on other paths.

**Reproduced (real LLM).** A multi-connection "Hybrid Agent" (a SQLite
connection + a `network_dir` connection with 2 active files) was attached to a
report alongside Music Store. With the agent's SQLite tables inactive so its only
active content is the network files:

```
SchemaContextBuilder → Hybrid Agent: rendered_tables=0  file_scopes=1
render_combined → Hybrid Agent present? False
```

Haiku, asked to list every data source including file-only ones, answered:

> "**Total Data Sources: 1 (Music Store)** … File Connections: **None.** There
> are no file-based connections … currently attached to this report."

The network-files agent is absent and the model explicitly denies any file
connection exists, though the `network_dir` connection with active files is
attached (`assets/report-context-file-source-denied.png`). Even when a
multi-connection agent IS kept (because its SQLite tables are active), its
network files still never appear in the combined context — `render_combined`
renders no `file_scopes` for any source.

**The "files glob + active tables" trap (single-connection network_dir).** A
`network_dir` agent with an `include_globs` pattern indexes each matched file as
a `DataSourceTable` row — so the agent's schema/tables page shows **active
tables** and the user reasonably believes it is populated. But those rows all
belong to the file-source connection, so `_build_file_scopes`
(`schema_context_builder.py:389`, `:450-515`) moves **every** one of them into
`file_scopes`, leaving `ds.tables == []`. `render_combined` then drops the whole
agent. Reproduced with a single `network_dir` agent ("Files Glob Agent",
`include_globs="*.csv,*.txt"`, 3 files activated) as the **only** source on a
report — Haiku answered:

> "**No data sources or files are currently attached to this report.** …
> data_sources: empty, files: empty, resources: empty … you would need to
> connect a data source."

(`assets/report-context-glob-agent-empty.png`.) This is the case that matches "an
agent with both files glob and active tables": the active tables ARE the glob
files, and they never survive into the combined context.

Regression test: `backend/tests/unit/test_report_context_file_source_omitted.py`
(full render includes the file source; combined render drops it).

## The fix (applied)

Rule implemented: **drop an agent only when ALL its connections are dead; if some
are healthy and some are not, render the healthy ones and flag the dead ones.**

Two files changed:

* **`app/ai/context/sections/tables_schema_section.py` — `render_combined`.**
  It now renders each `file_scopes` entry (via the existing
  `_render_file_scope_xml`, previously only reached by the full render) and a new
  `_render_unhealthy_connections_xml()` block, and the drop guard counts them:

  ```python
  if not (sample_xml or index_xml or mcp_xml or file_xml or unhealthy_xml):
      continue
  ```

  So a files-only agent (or a multi-connection agent whose relational side is
  down) is no longer omitted. A new `unhealthy_connections` field on the
  `DataSource` section carries the withheld connections.

* **`app/ai/context/builders/schema_context_builder.py`.** When it withholds a
  table because its connection is unhealthy (`Connection.is_active` False) it now
  records that connection, and passes the list to the section **only when at
  least one sibling is live** (`tables or file_scopes`). If every connection is
  dead the source still renders nothing and is dropped, as before.

**Verification (real LLM, post-fix).** The files-only glob agent as the only
source on a report — before the fix the model got `<data_sources></data_sources>`
and said "no data sources or files are currently attached." After:

> "You have access to one file connection right now: **Glob Files** (network
> directory) … 3 files: sales_q1.csv, sales_q2.csv, summary.txt … browse them
> with `list_files`, or read them directly with `read_file`."

And the multi-connection agent with a **dead DB + live network_dir** now renders:

```xml
<data_source name="Procurement Agent" ...>
  <connection name="Procurement Files" type="network_dir" kind="files" ...>
    <files>...3 PDFs...</files>
    <usage>search_files ... list_files ... read_file ...</usage>
  </connection>
  <unavailable_connections>
    <connection name="Procurement DB" type="sqlite">
      temporarily unreachable — its tables are withheld until it reconnects;
      do not attempt to query them.
    </connection>
  </unavailable_connections>
</data_source>
```

Regression guard: `backend/tests/unit/test_report_context_file_source_omitted.py`
(files-only agent kept; partial-connection agent kept + dead connection flagged;
truly-empty agent still dropped).

### Related, still open (separate issues)

- **Variant 1 (`ONBOARDING_MAX_TABLES = 0`)** — a brand-new relational agent with
  zero *activated* tables and no file side still renders empty and is dropped.
  That is table-activation UX, not this fix; a small positive default (the
  docstring at `data_source_service.py:4262` still says `20`) or a UI "0 tables
  active" hint would address it. Test still asserts the current behavior:
  `test_report_context_inactive_tables_omitted.py`.
- **UI health signal** — the agent tables page shows "6/6 active" while the
  backing connection is dead (`DataSourceTable.is_active` is independent of
  `Connection.is_active`); surfacing connection health there would remove the
  "looks fine but empty context" confusion at the source.

## What this proves / regression notes

The automatic schema context (`report.data_sources` → `SchemaContextBuilder` →
`render_combined`) and what the prompt box shows are governed independently, and
an attached agent with zero active tables is dropped from the former with no
signal. Loop A asserts the general invariant at the render layer; Loop B confirms
it against the real stack and a live model. The test asserts the invariant (empty
source ⇒ omitted), not one scripted agent, so it survives as a regression guard
for whichever fix reconciles the two.
