# Sandbox Feedback Loop Design

How Claude debugs, iterates, and validates changes in a local dev environment.

## How It Works

Local dev is already running (`python main.py` + `yarn dev`). The DB is `backend/db/app.db` (persistent SQLite). Claude uses curl to drive the app, pytest for backend validation, Playwright for visual validation, and sqlite3 to inspect state.

```
Claude edits code
  → backend auto-reloads (python main.py has reload=True)
  → frontend HMR picks up .vue/.ts changes (yarn dev)
  → Claude validates:
      Backend change?  → pytest
      Frontend change? → Playwright screenshot → Claude looks at it
      Either?          → sqlite3 db/app.db to inspect state
      Not sure?        → curl the API and check the response
```

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Requires Python 3.12+ (the codebase uses PEP 701 f-string syntax), Node 22, and yarn.

### System Dependencies

```bash
# Needed for psycopg2 build
apt-get install -y libpq-dev

# Upgrade setuptools (needed for thrift transitive dep)
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Use Python 3.12 venv (system python may be 3.11)
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install deps
pip install uv && uv sync --frozen --extra dev

# Required env vars (dev config references these)
export BOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db/app.db"
export BOW_SMTP_PASSWORD="dummy"

# Create directories and run migrations
mkdir -p db uploads/files uploads/branding
alembic upgrade head

# Start server (auto-reloads on .py changes)
python main.py &
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install

# Start dev server (HMR on .vue/.ts changes)
yarn dev &
```

### Playwright (for frontend screenshots)

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Vendored JS libs (required for `create_artifact`)

The artifact tool inlines Tailwind / React / ReactDOM / Babel / ECharts
into the HTML it sends to Playwright for rendering. It reads them from
`frontend/public/libs/`. On a fresh checkout that directory only holds
`artifact-globals.js`; without the rest, **any eval or interactive run
that exercises `create_artifact` fails with `FileNotFoundError:
tailwindcss-3.4.16.js`**.

Default (requires CDN egress):

```bash
bash scripts/download-vendor-libs.sh frontend/public/libs
```

npm fallback (for sandboxes that block the Tailwind / unpkg CDNs but
allow the npm registry):

```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d) && cd "$tmpdir" && npm init -y >/dev/null
npm install --silent --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund \
  react@18 react-dom@18 @babel/standalone echarts @tailwindcss/browser
LIBS=/home/user/bagofwords/frontend/public/libs
cp node_modules/@tailwindcss/browser/dist/index.global.js   "$LIBS/tailwindcss-3.4.16.js"
cp node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js               "$LIBS/react-18.development.js"
cp node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js       "$LIBS/react-dom-18.development.js"
cp node_modules/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js               "$LIBS/babel-standalone.min.js"
cp node_modules/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js                  "$LIBS/echarts-5.min.js"
cd - && rm -rf "$tmpdir"
```

`@tailwindcss/browser` is v4; the rendered artifacts look slightly
different from production (v3 Play CDN) but the tool completes and
persists its generated code so the judge can evaluate content — which
is what eval cases actually need.

Note: The dev config is loaded from `configs/bow-config.dev.yaml` (not the root `bow-config.yaml`).

## Session State: `backend/sandbox_state.json`

All session data (credentials, tokens, IDs) is stored in `backend/sandbox_state.json`. This file is **gitignored** — it never gets committed. Claude reads it at session start and updates it after setup/login.

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "email": "sandbox@bow.dev",
    "password": "Sandbox123!"
  },
  "session": {
    "token": "eyJ...",
    "org_id": "...",
    "ds_id": "..."
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "backend": "http://localhost:8000",
    "frontend": "http://localhost:3000"
  },
  "db_path": "backend/db/app.db"
}
```

## Sandbox Setup

### First-Time Setup

If the sandbox user doesn't exist yet (or `sandbox_state.json` has null session values):

```bash
# 1. Register sandbox user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "sandbox@bow.dev", "password": "Sandbox123!", "name": "Sandbox Admin"}'

# 2. Login — save the token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/jwt/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'username=sandbox@bow.dev&password=Sandbox123!'
# → {"access_token": "eyJ...", "token_type": "bearer"}

# 3. Get organization (auto-created on first user)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# → [{"id": "...", "name": "..."}]  — save the org id

# 4. Install demo data source (chinook SQLite)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/data_sources/demos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_ID"
# → list of demos — find chinook, save its id

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/data_sources/demos/$DEMO_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_ID"
# → {"id": "...", "data_source_id": "..."}  — save data source id

# 5. Update sandbox_state.json with token, org_id, ds_id
```

### Returning Session

If `sandbox_state.json` already has session values, just re-login to refresh the token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/jwt/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'username=sandbox@bow.dev&password=Sandbox123!'
# Update token in sandbox_state.json
```

## Auth Pattern

All API calls use the same auth headers:

```bash
curl -X {METHOD} http://localhost:8000/api/{endpoint} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## Popular Commands

### Reports

```bash
# Create report
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/reports \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Report", "data_sources": ["$DS_ID"]}'

# Get latest artifact
curl http://localhost:8000/api/artifacts/report/$REPORT_ID/latest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_ID"
```

## When curl Isn't Enough

If the endpoint isn't listed above, read the source of truth:

1. **Route file** (`backend/app/routes/*.py`) — endpoint path, method, auth, query params
2. **Pydantic schema** (`backend/app/schemas/*.py`) — exact request body shape, field types, defaults

Key route files:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `routes/report.py` | Reports CRUD |
| `routes/completion.py` | Chat completions, streaming |
| `routes/artifact.py` | Artifacts CRUD, export, previews |
| `routes/data_source.py` | Data sources CRUD, schema, metadata |
| `routes/instruction.py` | Instructions CRUD, bulk ops |
| `routes/llm.py` | LLM provider management |
| `routes/organization.py` | Organizations, members |
| `routes/query.py` | Saved queries |
| `routes/test.py` | Eval suites and runs |
| `routes/connection.py` | External connections |
| `routes/step.py` | Execution steps |
| `routes/build.py` | Build versioning |

## Backend Validation: pytest

For backend code changes. Uses existing test infrastructure — no modifications needed.

```bash
cd backend

# Run e2e tests
TESTING=true pytest -s -m e2e --db=sqlite --disable-warnings

# Run specific test
TESTING=true pytest -s -m e2e --db=sqlite -k test_create_report --disable-warnings

# Run AI tests (when changing backend/app/ai/**)
TESTING=true pytest -s -m ai --db=sqlite --disable-warnings
```

Pytest uses its own isolated DB (not `app.db`). Each test gets a fresh DB via fixtures. This matches CI exactly.

### Agent evals

The eval harness lives under `backend/tests/evals/`; suites are YAMLs
under `backend/tests/evals/suites/`. Cases run end-to-end against a
real LLM (skipped cleanly when the provider key is missing). Tag
markers come from each YAML so you can scope runs.

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

# single provider (all sanity cases ≈ 6 × duration-per-case)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_TEST=sk-ant-... \
  EVAL_LLMS="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6" \
  pytest -s tests/evals -m evals

# filter by tag (marker expressions work)
pytest -s tests/evals -m "evals and artifacts"
pytest -s tests/evals -m "evals and not judge"
EVAL_TAGS=smoke pytest -s tests/evals -m evals

# multiple providers at once
OPENAI_API_KEY_TEST=sk-... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_TEST=sk-ant-... \
  EVAL_LLMS="all" \
  pytest -s tests/evals -m evals
```

Per-case output appends to `$BOW_EVAL_REPORT` (default
`/tmp/bow_eval_report.jsonl`): one JSON line with status, failure
reason, totals (duration/tokens/iterations), rule-by-rule verdicts
(including judge prompt + reasoning), a flat tool trace, and a
per-turn completions breakdown (planner reasoning, tool calls,
final answer text per block) — useful for pivoting across providers.

Requires:
- the vendored JS libs populated (above) for any case that calls
  `create_artifact`,
- `BOW_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db/app.db` and `TESTING=true` (the test
  conftest wires up an isolated DB but the config loader still needs
  the env var set),
- chinook demo at `backend/demo-datasources/chinook.sqlite` (committed).

## Frontend Validation: Playwright + Claude's Eyes

For frontend/visual changes. Servers must be running.

### Run Existing Playwright Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npx playwright test --workers=2

# Run specific test suite
npx playwright test tests/reports/ --workers=1

# Run a single test file
npx playwright test tests/reports/create-report.spec.ts
```

### Quick Screenshot (Ad-Hoc)

```python
# Take a screenshot for Claude to evaluate
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:3000/reports/{report_id}')
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
    page.screenshot(path='/tmp/screenshot.png', full_page=True)
    browser.close()
```

Claude reads the screenshot to evaluate: Does it look right? Any errors? Data showing?

### Authenticated UI Inspection (logged-in pages)

Most pages (reports, settings, the chat thread) require auth, so the ad-hoc
snippet above lands on the sign-in screen. To screenshot a real logged-in view
— great for inspecting how a change actually renders (tool cards, blocks,
modals) — log in through the UI first. This needs the **local auth** provider
mounted, which the dev config gates behind `auth.mode`.

1. **Enable local auth** in `configs/bow-config.dev.yaml` (sandbox-only — keep
   it uncommitted, restore to `sso_only` when done):

   ```yaml
   features:
     allow_uninvited_signups: true
   auth:
     mode: "local_only"
   ```

   The backend reads this at startup, so touch a `.py` file (or restart) to make
   `uvicorn --reload` pick it up. Verify: `curl -s localhost:8000/api/settings`
   should show `"auth": {"mode": "local_only"}`. The sign-in form lives at
   `/users/sign-in` (fields: `input[type=text]` email, `input[type=password]`,
   `button[type=submit]`).

2. **Install the Chromium browser** for Playwright (the npm package ships
   without it):

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Log in, navigate, screenshot.** The `playwright` package is CommonJS, so
   from an ESM script import the default export, not a named one:

   ```js
   // /tmp/shot.mjs  →  run with:  node /tmp/shot.mjs
   import pkg from '/home/user/bagofwords/frontend/node_modules/playwright/index.js';
   const { chromium } = pkg;
   const b = await chromium.launch();
   const pg = await b.newPage({ viewport: { width: 1100, height: 1500 } });
   await pg.goto('http://localhost:3000/users/sign-in', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
   await pg.fill('input[type=text]', 'sandbox@bow.dev');
   await pg.fill('input[type=password]', 'Sandbox123!');
   await pg.click('button[type=submit]');
   await pg.waitForTimeout(4000);                       // let the session settle
   await pg.goto('http://localhost:3000/reports/' + process.env.RID, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
   await pg.waitForTimeout(6000);                       // let blocks stream/render
   await pg.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/render.png', fullPage: true });
   await b.close();
   ```

   Auth is a `Bearer` cookie named `auth_token` (sidebase nuxt-auth, see
   `nuxt.config.ts`); logging in via the form sets it plus the org state, which
   is simpler than injecting it. Reports keep their persisted blocks, so you can
   screenshot an existing completion without re-running the agent.

### Artifact Visual Validation

For LLM-generated UI (non-deterministic — can't assert, must look):

```
1. Create a completion that generates an artifact (via curl)
2. Playwright screenshots the rendered artifact
3. Claude looks at the screenshot
4. If wrong → edit code → servers hot-reload → re-trigger → re-screenshot
```

## State Inspection: SQLite

```bash
# If sqlite3 CLI is available:
sqlite3 backend/db/app.db "SELECT id, title, status FROM reports"
sqlite3 backend/db/app.db ".tables"

# If not (common in sandboxes), use Python:
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('backend/db/app.db')
for row in conn.execute('SELECT id, title, status FROM reports'):
    print(row)
conn.close()
"
```

## Decision Matrix

| Change | Validate with |
|---|---|
| Backend API/service/model | `pytest -s -m e2e --db=sqlite` |
| Backend AI logic | `pytest -s -m ai --db=sqlite` |
| Frontend component/page | Playwright screenshot → Claude evaluates |
| Artifact generation | curl → trigger creation → screenshot → Claude evaluates |
| Not sure what broke | `sqlite3 app.db` to inspect + server logs |

## What Stays Unchanged

- **Existing pytest fixtures** — for CI/CD, per-test isolation, deterministic
- **CI/CD workflows** (`e2e-tests.yml`) — sandbox is complementary, not a replacement
- **`backend/db/app.db`** — persistent, not wiped between iterations
