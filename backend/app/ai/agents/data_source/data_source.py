A few examples:
- Title: Top Customers
  Prompt: List the top 10 customers by revenue. Measure revenue by summing the total payments. Show name, email,  geo, total revenue, and total payments
- Title: Best Sellers
  Prompt: List the top 10 products by revenue. Measure revenue by summing the total payments. Show name, total revenue, and total payments
- Title: Unhappy Customers
  Prompt: List the top 10 customers by negative reviews. Show name, email, geo, total reviews, and total negative reviews
- Title: Customers Churn Root Cause
  Prompt: List the top 10 customers by churn. Show name, email, geo, total churn, and total churn reason.
- Title: Stray Cloud Users
  Prompt: List the top 10 users who are not in the cloud. Show name, email, geo, total users, and total users not in the cloud.

Example format:
[
    "Starter 1 Title\\nStarter 1 detailed prompt",

    "Starter 3 Title\\nStarter 3 detailed prompt",
    "Starter 4 Title\\nStarter 4 detailed prompt"

Important: in the output, do not include "Title" or "Prompt" in the output. just the list of conversation starters. Separete between Title and Prompt with a newline character.
Important: Return only the JSON array with no additional text, formatting, or explanations. Ensure all newlines are properly escaped with \\n.
Do not add prefix ``` or markdown or anything. just the list of conversation starters.

Data source/Agent name: {ds_name}

Schema:
{self.schema}
{existing_block}
Your task: write a single comprehensive instruction that the AI analytics agent will load every time it works with this data source. This instruction is its permanent reference card.

The instruction must cover:
- What this data source represents and its business purpose
- Key tables and what each tracks (1 line per table, focused on business meaning)
- Important relationships between tables (joins, foreign keys worth knowing)
- Any naming conventions, column quirks, or non-obvious facts visible in the schema (e.g. status codes, units, soft deletes)
- Primary identifiers and date/time columns to use for filtering

Rules:
- Be specific and factual — ground every claim in the schema, never invent
- No fluff, no generic statements like "this data source contains data about..."
- Write as direct instructions to the AI analyst ("Use X to...", "Always join on...", "Note that...")
- Plain prose with short bullet points where helpful
- 150–300 words
- When referencing a table from the schema, write its name as @TableName (e.g. @orders, @customers)
- When referencing an MCP tool from the schema, write its name as @tool_name (e.g. @search_products)

Please review the schema and the data source name and it client. Then, understand the nature of the data source, think about the purpose of the data source, and generate a description for the data source. Make it useful for a non-technical audience. 
Description should be max 3 sentences. Should be concise, valuable, and useful.

Guidelines:
- Make it personalized based on the data schema. 
- Don't make it generic.
- Don't make it too long. Max 3 sentences. No more than 280 characters.
- Don't use fluff words. Be direct and to the point.
- Be factual when describing the data source.
- Use simple language, make it extremely to point, not fluff, and be very brief and concise.
- Don't say "This data source contains information about...". Just describe the data source.

Examples:
- "Salesforce CRM data that provides information about customers, opportunities, leads, and marketing campaigns."
- "Google Analytics data that provides information about website traffic, user behavior, and marketing effectiveness."
- "Jira data that provides information about engineering projects, tasks, and team performance."
