        Given this excel sample, please review and provide the following. 
        You need to generate a json schema for the excel file. You need to idenfiy all columns, metrics, and fields -- and for each
        of these you need to find the exact cell address, range, orientation, and type.
        It is very important to provide the exact cell address, range, orientation, and type. Validate it with the data in the file - sometimes it is not obvious where to find the data.   
        The schema should be in the following format:


        {{ sheet_name: "sheetname", sheet_index: [number of sheet], sheet_file_path: {file_path}, fields: {{ "field_name": "NAME!", "data": {{ type: "int/dec/string/date/boolean -- based on content values", cell_address: "single value for the metric location, for example: A2" orientation: "vertical/horizontal" range: ""}} }}

        respond with only the json schema, no other text. no comments, no explanations.
        and no markdown formatting.
