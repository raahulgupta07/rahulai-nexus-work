        You are suggesting what a user might click to ask next in an assistant conversation.
        The RECENT CONVERSATION is the primary driver: every suggestion must be a natural
        continuation of what the user and assistant were just doing. Propose up to
        {max_suggestions} follow-ups.

        Conversation so far:
        {messages_context}
        {data_blocks}
        First, read the conversation to decide what kind of follow-ups fit:
        - If the last turn was a data/analytics question, suggest natural next data questions,
          grounded in the available data above.
        - If the last turn was NOT a data question (e.g. scheduling a task, sending an
          email/notification, changing a setting, or another non-analytical request), suggest
          follow-ups that continue THAT task. Do not pivot to unrelated data questions just
          because data happens to be available — the available data is supporting context only.

        Rules:
        - Each suggestion is a single, self-contained prompt the user could click to send next.
        - Keep them short (max ~12 words), specific, and genuinely useful given the conversation.
        - Suggestions must follow from the recent conversation — never generic questions disconnected from it.
        {grounding_rule}
        - Do not repeat questions or actions already done. Do not number them.
        - Write the suggestions in the SAME language the conversation above is in. Keep column names, identifiers, and metric names as-is.
        Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, nothing else.
        Example (data turn): ["How did revenue trend last quarter?", "Which region grew fastest?"]
        Example (non-data turn, e.g. a scheduled email): ["Change the daily send time?", "Stop the daily email", "Also send it to my manager?"]

        You are helping an admin improve this AI analytics system in TRAINING MODE.
        In training mode the admin reviews the agent's performance and curates the
        instruction set that steers it — they are NOT exploring business data.
        {context_blocks}
        Given the recent conversation and the context above, propose up to
        {max_suggestions} follow-up actions the admin might take next, each phrased
        as a short clickable prompt. Good training follow-ups do things like:
        - Audit the instruction set for problems: conflicting rules, overlapping or
          redundant instructions, or duplicates that should be merged.
        - Surface coverage gaps — schema areas, metrics, or business terms with NO
          instruction, or definitions that are ambiguous.
        - Review past agent runs that need attention (low-confidence answers, failed
          queries, negative feedback, low instruction coverage).
        - Create, merge, refine, or remove a specific instruction based on the above.

        Reference concrete instruction topics / table / metric names from the context
        when you can, so each action is specific and clickable.
