"""Build a native multi-turn transcript from the planner's existing state.

Migration bridge. The agent loop already records everything a transcript needs
— `observation_builder.tool_observations` holds `tool_name`, `tool_input` and
the observation per `loop_index` — it is just re-serialized into one user
message instead of being replayed as turns.

This module reconstructs turns from that record, so the native path can be
switched on without the agent loop having to maintain a parallel structure
first. Once the loop keeps a `Transcript` directly, this becomes unnecessary.

Off unless enabled: `BOW_PLANNER_TRANSCRIPT=1`, or `PlannerInput.use_transcript`.

Known limitation: provider tool_use ids are dropped after pairing in
planner_v3, so ids are synthesized here. They only have to be internally
consistent within a single request, which they are.
