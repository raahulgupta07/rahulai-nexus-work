"""MCP Tools: Instructions - List, create, and delete instructions with permission-aware build integration.

These tools allow external LLM clients (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to manage instructions.
- Non-admins can suggest instructions (builds go to pending_approval for admin review)
- Admins get auto-approved builds that go live immediately

Instructions are organizational knowledge that guide AI behavior when generating code
and analyzing data.
