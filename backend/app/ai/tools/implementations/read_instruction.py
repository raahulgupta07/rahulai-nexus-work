"""Read Instruction Tool — pull the full text of a single instruction or skill on demand.

Instructions and skills are advertised in the prompt (<available_skills> and
<available_instructions>) as a compact catalog of short id + title + description,
with their full text withheld. When the agent decides an entry is relevant to
the user's request, it calls this tool with the short id prefix to load the
full text.

Design constraints (progressive disclosure):
  - Available wherever the catalog is advertised — chat, deep and the editing
    modes (training / knowledge). Two independent reasons, and both matter:
    it was chat-only until 2026-07-26, which meant deep analysis saw
    <available_skills> with no way to fetch any of it; and an anchored
    edit_instruction can only match text the agent has actually read, so the
    read tool has to exist wherever editing happens.
  - Resolves any published instruction (kind='instruction' or 'skill').
  - Accepts the SHORT id prefix (first part of the UUID), not just the full id.
  - HARD-SCOPED to the current report's agents: the id is verified against the
    report's data sources (or global instructions) and per-user table
    accessibility before any text is returned. When no report scope can be
    resolved, the tool refuses instead of falling back to org-wide reads.
  - Records an 'on_demand' usage event so agent-pulled instructions climb the
    usage-based ranking of the fill/catalog ordering.
