"""Send Email Tool - sends a free-form email to the requesting user.

The recipient is always the current user (resolved from runtime context), so the
agent cannot email anyone else. Subject and body are free-form. This is the first
of a planned family of notification tools (email today; Slack / WhatsApp / Teams
in the future) — each channel gets its own tool so the UI status stays per-channel.

Emails may carry up to 5 attachments. Each attachment is generated on the fly from
something the assistant already produced in this report: a visualization/query
result (CSV/XLSX), an artifact (PPTX for slides, PDF for page dashboards), or an
uploaded file (attached as-is). All references are scoped to the current report /
organization so the agent cannot exfiltrate arbitrary objects.

The attachment resolution + send is delegated to ``EmailSendService`` so the same
logic backs the external MCP send_email tool.
