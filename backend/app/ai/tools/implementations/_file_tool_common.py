      Chromium uses for PDFs — as a self-contained wheel, so no system poppler
      and no headless-browser launch).
    - Office documents (docx/pptx/…) are converted to PDF with LibreOffice
      first, then rasterized by the same path. Their layout doesn't exist until
      a layout engine has run, so without this a text-free Word file — one
      wrapping scanned images, say — had no vision fallback at all.

    ``file_id`` is used only to pick the format, so pass the file's real NAME
    when the id is opaque (Graph item ids carry no extension).

    Returns ``(images, total_pages)`` where ``images`` is a list of
    ``(png_bytes, "image/png")``, capped at ``max_pages``. Best-effort: returns
    ``([], 0)`` when the payload isn't a renderable binary or the renderer is
    unavailable, so the caller simply keeps the original (binary) result.

    Blocking — the PDF rasterizer is CPU-bound and the Office path spawns a
    subprocess. Call it from a worker thread.
