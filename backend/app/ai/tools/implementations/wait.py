"""Wait Tool — pause the current task, then automatically resume after a delay.

The agent calls this when the right next move is to wait for real-world time to
pass before retrying — an ETL/refresh in progress, a rate limit, "try again in
30 minutes". It ends the current turn (like clarify) and arms a one-shot resume
job via ``WaitService``. When the timer elapses, the agent is re-run on this
report with ``reason`` as the instruction and full history reloaded.

This is NOT a scheduled task: it's one-shot, ephemeral, and fires exactly once.
For recurring work use ``create_scheduled_task``.
