"""Shared helpers for the agent focus tools (search_agents / set_report_agents).

"Agent" == ``DataSource``. Selection semantics:

  - ``report.data_sources`` EMPTY = **Auto**: the user delegated scoping, so the
    working set is every agent they can access and the tools act freely.
  - Non-empty = **manual**: the user picked agents, and that selection is a HARD
    scope — search and focus operate on the selected agents only; other
    accessible agents are never searched, loaded, or proposed. The user changes
    the scope themselves from the agent selector.
  - **training**: the actor curates agents they MANAGE (org-level
    ``manage_instructions`` → all agents, or a per-agent ``manage`` grant).
