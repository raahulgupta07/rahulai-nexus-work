            Purpose:
Execute a tool on a connected MCP server or custom API endpoint.
Returns the tool's output. EVERY successful call saves the FULL result to a file
and returns its `file_id` — tabular results as CSV, everything else as JSON or
text. As much of the result as fits the inline budget is returned in `preview`.
Read `preview_truncated` before deciding what to do next:
    - false → `preview` IS the complete result. Answer from it directly; do not
      spend another call re-reading what you already have.
    - true → `preview` holds the first `preview_row_count` of `row_count`
      records. Never answer from a partial list, and never rebuild the data
      from it — get the rest first.
Pick the next step by what you need, not by the result's type:
    - READ more records → read_file(file_id=…, offset=…), paging with the
      returned next_cursor. Byte-offset windows may start mid-record.
    - records this call never fetched → if the observation carries
      `result_metadata` with a cursor, call this tool again with it
    - chart or aggregate → create_data(source_file_ids=[file_id])
    - need it as a CSV → write_csv(source_file_ids=[file_id])
Never try to call this connection from generated Python — generated code has no
access to it.

Use when:
    - You need to fetch data from an external tool (Notion, Jira, Datadog, etc.)
    - You need to invoke an API endpoint to retrieve or submit data
    - If a tool's <mcp_tools> entry shows no <arg> elements (or the tool isn't
      listed), call search_mcps first for its schema; entries WITH <arg>
      elements are complete — call directly.

Argument typing — `arguments` is validated against the tool's real schema
before the call goes out, so match declared types exactly:
    - An arg typed "string" takes a STRING even when its content is JSON —
      serialize the JSON (vendors like monday and Jira use this shape for
      column/field maps).
    - An arg typed "integer" takes a NUMBER — a unix epoch is 1740787200,
      not "2026-03-01". An arg with enum= takes exactly one listed value;
      integer enums are numbers, not labels.
    - Nested <arg> elements = an OBJECT of that shape; <item> = an ARRAY of
      objects, not an array of strings.
    - Omit optional arguments you have no value for — never pass null or "".

Do not use when:
    - You need to query a SQL database (use create_data instead)
    - You need to read uploaded files (use inspect_data instead)
