"""Create Scheduled Task Tool - schedules a recurring task on the current report.

This is a thin wrapper over ScheduledPromptService. It stores ``task_prompt`` as
a recurring prompt and registers an APScheduler cron job. When the job fires, the
agent re-runs that prompt autonomously and picks whatever tools it needs —
including send_email — so the email content is whatever the agent decides to
write, exactly like a live chat. Nothing email-specific is baked in here.

The recipient/owner is always the requesting user, and the task always belongs to
the current report (both resolved from runtime context).
