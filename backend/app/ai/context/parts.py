"""Typed conversation parts — the unit the agent transcript is built from.

Today the planner re-serializes prior tool results into one rebuilt user
message (`<past_observations>` / `<last_observation>`). These types are the
replacement: an append-only list of typed parts that renders to native
provider messages through a single seam.

Three ideas carry the design:

* **Two views of a result.** ``content`` is model-visible and budgeted;
  ``metadata`` is UI / audit only and never reaches the model or the
  compaction summarizer.
* **A decay ladder rather than one compaction step.** ``content`` (fresh) →
  ``digest`` (the tool's own compact form, computed once at execution time) →
  a summary part → dropped-but-referenceable. Decaying a part is a field
  swap, not an LLM call.
* **Provider-opaque state is carried, not invented.** ``signature`` +
  ``provider_name`` travel with the call/thinking that produced them and are
  replayed only to the provider that issued them — a mid-run fallback to a
  different provider must drop them rather than forward them.
