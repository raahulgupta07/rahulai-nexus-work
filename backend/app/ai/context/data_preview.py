"""Budgeted, self-describing data previews for tool observations.

Single source of truth for how create_data / read_query results are rendered
into the LLM prompt. Replaces scattered ``rows[:5]`` slices.

The *latest* observation carries as many rows as fit a byte budget (so small
results — the common case — come through whole), mirroring how ``read_artifact``
keeps full code for one iteration. Larger results degrade to head+tail with an
explicit truncation note. Older observations are sampled down separately by the
observation compaction layer.
