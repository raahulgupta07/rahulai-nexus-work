        is what produced the SQLite-N=10 cascade — one INSERT got the
        OperationalError "database is locked", the agent's session entered
        PendingRollback, and every subsequent self.db.* in the run failed.
        On Postgres the same pattern surfaces as a stale connection from
        an asyncio.wait_for cancellation, with identical cascade. We open
        a fresh short-lived session per call instead. ORM instances that
        outlive this call (inv.current_step, inv.current_visualization,
        inv.current_query) are kept around for downstream code that only
        reads `.id` off them — after the fresh session exits they are
        detached, but the PK columns remain readable.

        `inv` scopes the created query/step/visualization to ONE tool
        invocation so concurrent tool calls can't cross-attribute each
        other's objects. Callers that predate per-invocation state pass
