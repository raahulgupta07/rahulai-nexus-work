        headline v0.0.503 feature: when the user pins nothing, `set_report_agents`
        deliberately does NOT attach ("attaching would silently convert Auto into
        a manual pin" — its own comment), so `report.data_sources` stays empty,
        no client is ever built, and `create_data` — which resolves tables by
        walking `ctx.data_sources` — finds nothing. Reproduced 3/3 here and 1/1
        on a vanilla 0.0.503 image, always as:

            search_agents ✓ → set_report_agents ✓ → create_data ✗ ✗ ✗
            "No active tables matched the requested patterns"

        `describe_tables` and `inspect_data` succeed throughout, which is the
        tell: focus grants SCHEMA visibility but never query capability. The
        invariant this method exists to hold is "anything the planner can see,
        it can query" — so it has to read the same set the planner was shown.

        Access is re-checked rather than trusting the stored id list:
        `focused_data_source_ids` is a plain JSON column written by whoever
        asked LAST, and the person asking NOW may be someone else on a shared
        report — so a stale, inherited or hand-edited entry must not become a
        query client.

        ★The gate is `user_can_focus_agent`, deliberately the SAME one
        `set_report_agents` rejects with, NOT `accessible_agents`. The first
        version of this method used `accessible_agents` and that was wrong:
        it is a VISIBILITY helper (it builds the roster) and it is strictly
        broader — measured on this instance, member@ was "reachable" for 4/4
        agents but permitted for only 1/4. Using it here meant an admin could
        focus an agent, a member could open the shared report, and this method
        would hand that member a live client for data the focus tool itself
        would have refused them.

            render full schema ONLY for the focused subset, and return a thin
            ``<available_agents>`` roster listing every attached agent so the
            model still knows what exists and can pull others in via
            search_agents.

        Focus is re-resolved every planner turn so a mid-run set_report_agents
        call takes effect on the next iteration.

        A list of ``{"rows": [...]}`` — the same shape `verify_findings` takes
        for a dashboard's visualizations, so one verifier serves both.

        Scope is the report, not the single turn: a chat thread is one run, and
        an answer may legitimately cite a figure computed three turns ago. It is
        NOT widened past the report: pulling in another report's rows would make
        the pool so large that any figure would find a match, and a check that
        accepts everything is worse than none because it reports `checked=True`.

        Three sources, unioned and de-duplicated:

        1. Steps reached through their widget on this report. Rows come from
           `resolve_artifact_rows`, the one accessor every render path uses —
           checking prose against the 1,000-row display prefix while the
           dashboard beside it renders the wider copy would reject correct
           totals. Unchanged; this is the original path.
        2. Steps this report's own tool calls created, reached through
           `ToolExecution.created_step_id` instead of through a widget. ★On the
           live install this is today a strict SUBSET of (1) — measured across
           535 tool executions carrying a `created_step_id`, ZERO had a widget
           on a different report, and `Step.widget_id` is `nullable=False`, so
           no step is widget-less. It is here for the case the join cannot
           express: a step whose widget belongs to a report other than this one
           (a `read_query` or `edit_artifact` reaching a shared query), where
           the answer legitimately cites rows this run pulled up. Cheap, and it
           can only ever add.
        3. Numbers printed by this report's tool RESULTS. This is the one that
           changed the coverage. Measured over 405 completed turns: 169 (42%)
           resolved no dataset at all, and 46 of those stated a four-or-more
           digit figure in the text the user reads — with the tool mix on
           exactly those turns being `inspect_data` (21) and `read_file` (5).
           Those turns produce no Step and never will: an `inspect_data` peek
           returns a printed log, a `read_file` returns text. Sources (1) and
           (2) are structurally empty there, so `verify_narrative` returned
           `checked=False` and the exploration answers — the very ones the
           observed fabrication came from, written "from working memory during
           exploration" — were the ones never checked. The rows the model was
           shown are in that text; harvesting them is what lets the check run.

        Returns [] on any trouble. The caller reads that as "cannot resolve the
        run's data" and leaves the narrative alone. Each source is wrapped
        separately so one failing source cannot cost the other two.

        is what produced the SQLite-N=10 cascade — one INSERT got the

        PendingRollback, and every subsequent self.db.* in the run failed.
        On Postgres the same pattern surfaces as a stale connection from
        an asyncio.wait_for cancellation, with identical cascade. We open
        a fresh short-lived session per call instead. ORM instances that
        outlive this call (inv.current_step, inv.current_visualization,
        inv.current_query) are kept around for downstream code that only
        reads `.id` off them — after the fresh session exits they are
        detached, but the PK columns remain readable.

        invocation so concurrent tool calls can't cross-attribute each
