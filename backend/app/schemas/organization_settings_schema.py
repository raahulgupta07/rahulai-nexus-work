# Unlike LDAP/SMTP (which are per-organization), SSO is instance-global: it
# governs how any user signs in, so it is stored on the singleton

# Fernet-encrypted at rest as ``client_secret_enc`` and NEVER returned — the
# read shapes expose only ``client_secret_set: bool``. When the instance has no
# saved block, everything falls back to the file config (``bow-config.yaml`` →
# ``settings.dash_config``) so existing file-based setups keep working; the
# ``source_db`` flag tells the UI which is in effect. Mirrors the SMTP/LDAP
# secret pattern.
