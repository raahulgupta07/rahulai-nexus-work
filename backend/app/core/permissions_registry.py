"""
Central registry of all permission strings used in the application.

This is the single source of truth for valid permissions. Route decorators
reference these strings, the frontend receives them via whoami, and the
RolesManager UI groups them by category for the role editor.

Reports use legacy permission strings for backwards compatibility with
existing route decorators, but they are HIDDEN from the role editor UI:
view/create are effectively granted to all members; update/delete/publish
are gated by ownership in the route layer (see `owner_only=True` on the
report routes). The hidden category lets us keep the strings valid in the
resolver without exposing meaningless checkboxes in the UI.

Connection view is derived from data_source access; connection write is
gated by the org-level `manage_connections` permission. There are no
connection or report resource grants.
