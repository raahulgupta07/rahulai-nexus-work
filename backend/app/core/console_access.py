"""Who may open the monitoring console, and over which agents.

Every ``/console/*`` endpoint used to require org-level ``manage_settings``,
which made monitoring an admin-only surface. But the person who most needs to
see an agent's runs, failures and spend is whoever *manages that agent*, so the
gate is two-tier:

* org admins keep the org-wide view — ``manage_settings``, the
  ``full_admin_access`` wildcard, or ``manage_connections`` (org-wide
  data-source governance, the same permission that unlocks the admin
  "show all agents" listing);
* anyone holding ``manage`` on at least one agent gets in, scoped to exactly
  those agents (the same permission that scopes the review feed and the inbox);
* everyone else is denied.

``ConsoleScope`` carries that decision. ``data_source_ids is None`` means
"org-wide, no filtering"; a list means "only these agents". Routes push the
caller's own agent filter through ``scoped_params`` so a scoped manager can
narrow their view but never widen it past their grants.
