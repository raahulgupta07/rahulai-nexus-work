"""Policy: when must a shared artifact's creator snapshot be hidden from viewers?

A shared dashboard's Step.data snapshot is materialized under the CREATOR's
data-source credentials. When the report is in viewer-identity mode
(reports.shared_run_identity == 'viewer') and its data comes from a
user-scoped connection (auth_policy != 'system_only', i.e. every user
queries with their own credentials), showing that snapshot to other users
leaks rows their own credentials would never return. In that combination,
non-owner readers get no snapshot — they see their own step_user_results
after running, or nothing.

System-only connections are exempt: everyone's credentials are the same
ones, so the snapshot is not credential-differentiated and hiding it would
only regress plain sharing. 'creator' mode is exempt by definition — the
owner explicitly opted to run and share their own view.

Every surface that serves step rows — the read endpoints, CSV/XLSX export,
PDF/thumbnail/PPTX renders, the websocket step broadcast, Slack step
notifications — must resolve what a given reader may see through
resolve_step_data (or report_snapshot_withheld for report-level renders with
no user in scope) instead of reading Step.data directly. See the comment
banner on the Step.data column.
