"""NotifyService — deliver a free-form message to org members across channels.

This is the channel-agnostic generalization of ``send_email``. The agent (or a
scheduled run) hands it a subject/body, optional report-scoped attachments, and a
set of recipient **emails**; the service:

1. **Resolves + authorizes recipients** against the org's ``memberships`` — only
   active members or pending invites are accepted, never free-form outsiders.
   The requesting user (self) is ALWAYS added, so the sender keeps a copy.
2. **Always delivers in-app** via :class:`InboxService` (the per-user inbox from
   the notification center) for every recipient that has a user account.
3. **Adds one external nudge per recipient**: the recipient's preferred verified
   chat platform (Teams → Slack) if reachable, else email. Never both — in-app is
   the always-on layer, the external nudge is a one-way pointer back into the app.

The membership check is the security boundary; it lives here so the internal
``notify`` tool and the external MCP path share exactly one implementation.
Reply-threading (a recipient replying re-attaches to a report) is kept owner-only
by only passing ``system_completion`` through for the self recipient.
