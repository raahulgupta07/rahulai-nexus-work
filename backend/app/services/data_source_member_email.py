"""Delayed "you've been added to a data source" member notifications.

When a user is added as a member of a data source (an "agent" in product
terms), we email them — but only if SMTP is configured, and only after a short
delay. The delay is the whole point: if the add was a mistake and the
membership is removed within the window, the email is never sent. Send time
re-checks that the membership still exists before mailing.

The job is scheduled on the shared APScheduler (``date`` trigger), so it
survives a process restart and runs even if the request worker is gone. Every
worker runs its own scheduler against the shared job store, so the send path
claims the run to guarantee exactly one email.
