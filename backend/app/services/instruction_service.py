        ``verify=True`` (detail, review, accept/reject) is authoritative. It runs
        the word-level 3-way rebase for suggestions whose base no longer matches
        main, which is what makes a *covered* suggestion — one whose change is
        already applied — correctly read as "Active" rather than pending.

        ``verify=False`` (the /agents tree badges and the instruction list) answers
        from equality alone and NEVER diffs. Every conclusive case is still exact:
        a suggestion that proposes what main already has is not pending, and one
        whose base still matches main is pending. Only the drifted remainder —
        base moved on since the suggestion forked — is reported optimistically as
        pending without confirming the hunk survives the rebase.

        That is a deliberate trade. Rebasing is quadratic in the instruction text
        (a 15k-character instruction costs seconds), and a page that renders a dot
        cannot afford dozens of them; a workspace with 76 drifted rows measured 20s+
        on both endpoints. The dot resolves the moment the instruction is opened,
        which runs the authoritative tier for that one row.

        candidate_ids, when provided, restricts the (expensive) per-instruction

        matching and the row is re-evaluated like any other. Carry-over rows
        (proposed text == base text) are skipped, and ``build_ids`` scopes the

        review and must go live immediately — the retrieval user-scope filter
        keeps them invisible to everyone else).
