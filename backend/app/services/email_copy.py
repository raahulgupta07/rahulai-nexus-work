"""Plain-text copy for transactional emails.

Kept as small pure functions returning (subject, body) so the wording lives in
one place, reads like a person wrote it, and is trivial to test/preview. Bodies
are plain text on purpose -- no HTML, no buttons; links go inline on their own
line so they stay clickable in any client.
