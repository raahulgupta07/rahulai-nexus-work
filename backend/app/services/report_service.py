        * the report must have opted in via `refresh_on_view`;
        * `_check_visibility` decides who may trigger it, exactly as it decides
          who may read the page;
        * the staleness gate is the rate limit. The interval is a server-side
          constant, not an owner-settable field, so no configuration can push
          this above one rerun per REFRESH_ON_VIEW_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS per
          report no matter how much traffic the page gets;
        * the claim collapses the herd. The staleness gate alone races: N
          concurrent viewers all read the same stale `last_run_at` before any
          rerun commits, and all N fire. `claim_scheduled_run` settles it with a
          unique (job_id, bucket) insert, across workers and replicas, keyed on
          that shared `last_run_at` — the state they are all racing to replace.

        Losers of either guard get `skipped: True` and the page renders the data
        it already has — nobody waits on someone else's rerun.

        The rerun executes as the report OWNER, not the viewer: the viewer may
        be anonymous, and the queries need the owner's data-source credentials.
        This mirrors what the scheduled path already does.
