class CompletionEventQueue:
    """Fan-out broadcaster for streaming SSE events during a completion.

    The agent produces events with put(); any number of consumers each read
    from their own bounded queue:

    - The kickoff request's StreamingResponse consumes the primary queue via
      get_events() (created eagerly so events emitted before the response
      generator starts are never lost).
    - Reconnecting watchers (page refresh, network blip, second tab) call
      subscribe() and receive events from that point on; they recover earlier
      state from the DB snapshot, which every event-persisting write precedes.

    Every queue is bounded to _QUEUE_MAXSIZE so a slow or dead consumer cannot
    cause unbounded memory growth: when a subscriber's queue is full, put()
    drops the event for that subscriber and logs a warning rather than
    blocking the agent loop. Dropped block-level events are recovered by the
    1.2s full-text snapshots and idempotent block.upsert payloads.
