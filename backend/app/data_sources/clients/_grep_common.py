"""Shared line-grep engine for file-source clients (network_dir, s3, …).

Backs the `grep_files` capability: deterministic regex over raw file bytes,
returning matching LINES (with line numbers and context) plus explicit sweep
accounting — files scanned, files skipped and why, why the sweep stopped, and
a cursor to resume. The point is reduction at the source: the agent gets the
hits and a count, never the whole log.

The engine is pure and client-agnostic: each client supplies an ordered
candidate list (already scoped/filtered through its own resolve chokepoint)
and a byte-reader; matching, context, budgets, binary sniffing, and cursor
semantics live here so every file source behaves identically — the same
philosophy as the shared windowed-read contract.

Text detection is content-based (a NUL-byte sniff), NOT an extension
allowlist: any file whose bytes look like text is greppable (.txt, .log,
.csv, .ndjson, extensionless, …). Real binaries are skipped and reported.
