## Power BI DAX Query Guide

Execute DAX queries against Power BI semantic models.

### CRITICAL: never pull a whole table to compute a number (DEF-006)

The Power BI `executeQueries` endpoint SILENTLY returns a partial result — a hard
100,000-row cap, and fewer than that when rows are wide (a real 300,086-row table
came back as 48,222 rows with no warning of any kind). Aggregating a partial pull in
pandas produces a confidently WRONG answer that looks completely plausible.

So: **make Power BI do the aggregation and return only the small result you need.**
A bare `EVALUATE <Table>` on a large table is rejected at runtime — it is not a
fallback you can retry.

```dax
-- Top N: do NOT pull the table and sort in pandas
EVALUATE TOPN(5, SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(Orders[Code], "Total", SUM(Orders[Amount])), [Total], DESC)

-- Grouped totals
EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(Orders[Category], "Total", SUM(Orders[Amount]))

-- Scalars: row counts, distinct counts, sums
EVALUATE ROW("n", COUNTROWS(Orders), "distinct_codes", DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Code]))
```

Pull raw rows only when the user genuinely needs row-level detail, and filter or
`TOPN` it down in DAX first. This is also far faster: one aggregate query returns in
seconds where a full-table pull takes a minute and is wrong anyway.

### Schema Structure

Each Power BI table is exposed as a separate schema table named `Dataset/Table`:
- `SalesModel/Customers` - Customers table in SalesModel dataset
- `SalesModel/Orders` - Orders table in SalesModel dataset

Tables in the same dataset share the same `metadata.powerbi.datasetId` and can be joined via relationships (see `fks` field).

### Table Name vs DAX Table Name

- **Schema table name** (e.g., `SalesModel/Customers`) - Pass as second argument to `execute_query()`
- **DAX table name** - The part after `/` (e.g., `Customers`) - Use inside DAX queries

The DAX table name is also available in `metadata.powerbi.tableName`.

### How to Execute Queries

**Signature**: `execute_query(dax_query, table_name)` - BOTH arguments are REQUIRED!

```python
# Schema table name as 2nd arg, DAX table name in query
df = db_clients['powerbi'].execute_query(
    "EVALUATE Customers",           # DAX uses the table name (after /)
    "SalesModel/Customers"          # Schema table name (REQUIRED)
)

# Or with explicit IDs from the table's <powerbi datasetId=... workspaceId=.../> metadata:
df = db_clients['powerbi'].execute_query(
    "EVALUATE Customers",
    dataset_id="<datasetId>",
    workspace_id="<workspaceId>",
)
```

Every table's `datasetId`/`workspaceId` are shown in the schema context — NEVER ask the user for them.

### DAX Query Pattern

```dax
EVALUATE <table_expression>
```

### Examples

```dax
-- Row-level detail ONLY (never to compute an aggregate — see the rule above).
-- Rejected at runtime on a large table; filter or TOPN it down in DAX first.
EVALUATE TOPN(100, Customers)
EVALUATE 'Order Details'

-- Aggregate with grouping
EVALUATE
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
    Orders[Category],
    "Total", SUM(Orders[Amount])
)

-- Filter data
EVALUATE
FILTER(
    Customers,
    Customers[Status] = "Active"
)

-- Top N results
EVALUATE
TOPN(10,
    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(Customers[Name], "Total", SUM(Orders[Value])),
    [Total], DESC
)
```

### Key DAX Syntax Rules
- Table names with spaces MUST use single quotes: 'Order Details'[Column]
- Column references: TableName[ColumnName] or 'Table Name'[ColumnName]
- Measure references: [MeasureName] (no table prefix)
- String literals use double quotes: "value"
- Relationships between tables are in `fks` - use RELATED() to traverse them
- An EMPTY `fks` list means the relationships could not be READ during indexing
  (that needs tenant-admin scope we may not have), NOT that the model has none.
  Never tell the user that tables cannot be joined, or that a table has no key
  to another, on the basis of missing `fks` - you cannot see that from here.
  The model's relationships are enforced by the DAX engine at query time
  regardless of what we indexed, so cross-table aggregation just works:
  `EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(Dim[Attr], "Total", SUM(Fact[Value]))` resolves the
  join itself. Try the query; a wrong-grain result is the signal there is no
  usable relationship, and a `[hidden]` column is still fully queryable.
- Measures are the model's OWN business logic. When one exists for what is being
  asked (e.g. a total, a rate, an average), invoke it by name - `[Measure Name]`
  - instead of re-deriving it from raw columns with SUM/DIVIDE. A hand-rolled
  equivalent will not reproduce the measure's filter context and will disagree
  with the customer's own reports. `[measure -> Number]` shows what it returns;
  the definition is not always readable, and you do not need it to call it.
- Row-level security may be filtering your results and you CANNOT tell. A
  row-filtered query returns HTTP 200 with fewer rows - indistinguishable from a
  genuinely small result - and whether a model is row-secured is not readable
  through the API with a normal user's token. A `rowLevelSecurity` marker in a
  table's Power BI metadata confirms RLS when present, but its ABSENCE proves
  nothing. So never describe a Power BI total as organization-wide, company-wide
  or complete: report it as the data visible to the current user. If the
  distinction matters for the answer, say so explicitly.
- Bare INFO.TABLES() / INFO.COLUMNS() / INFO.RELATIONSHIPS() do NOT work via the
  REST API (HTTP 400). The INFO.VIEW.* family DOES work - INFO.VIEW.TABLES(),
  INFO.VIEW.COLUMNS(), INFO.VIEW.MEASURES(), INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS() - so use
  those to inspect the model when the indexed schema looks incomplete.
- NEVER reference columns named `RowNumber-<GUID>` even if they appear in the
  schema - they are internal engine columns and any query using them fails
- In expression slots of SUMMARIZECOLUMNS / ADDCOLUMNS / ROW, a bare column
  reference fails with "A single value for column ... cannot be determined".
  Wrap it in an aggregation (MIN/MAX/COUNTROWS/...) or, for distinct values,
  group by the column instead: `EVALUATE SUMMARIZE(Users, Users[UserId])` or
  `EVALUATE DISTINCT(Users[UserId])`
