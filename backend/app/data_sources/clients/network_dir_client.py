"""Network-directory file-source client.

Backs the `network_dir` data source type: a local folder or an already-mounted
network share (SMB/NFS) exposed to the agent as a file catalog. It gives the
agent the filesystem primitives it would otherwise reach for on a shell —
`ls`/`find` (list_files), `grep -ril` (search_files, filename + content),
`grep -n` (grep_files, matching lines + context), `cat` (read_file) — plus,
when the connection is writable, `cp`/`put` (write_file).

Everything is confined to the configured `root_path`: every id resolves back to
a path *inside* root, and traversal outside it (`..`, absolute escapes,
symlinks that point out) is rejected. File ids are the POSIX-relative path under
root — stable and human-readable, so the LLM can round-trip them naturally.

Declares LIST_FILES + READ_FILE + SEARCH_FILES + GREP_FILES always; WRITE_FILE
only when the connection is configured writable (dropped from the *instance*
capabilities otherwise so runtime resolution rejects a write against a
read-only dir).
