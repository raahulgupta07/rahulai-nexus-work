"""Shared helpers for file-source clients (network_dir, s3, …).

Keeps the two file connectors aligned on the things that would otherwise
drift: glob-scope parsing + matching (used both to FILTER listings and to
ENFORCE access at the resolve chokepoint), and the index-mode enum that
controls how much of a source gets cached.

Design: the include-globs act as an *access boundary*, not just a listing
filter. `path_matches_globs` is called from each client's resolve chokepoint,
so a read/attach of a real-but-out-of-scope file (a `.env` next to the ppts)
is rejected the same way a path escaping the root is.
