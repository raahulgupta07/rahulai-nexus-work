    Used by the tool layer to map a client to the agent-callable tools it can

    LIST_FILES + READ_FILE. A single client may declare both — e.g. SharePoint
    declaring LIST_FILES + READ_FILE for general files and QUERY for promoted
    spreadsheet ranges.

    WRITE_FILE is the only mutating file capability: a client that declares it
    can create/overwrite files back in the source (e.g. a writable network
    directory). Read-only file sources must NOT declare it. Because write is a
    trust-sensitive operation, clients gate it per-instance — the class may
    advertise WRITE_FILE (so the write tool shows in the catalog) while a
    read-only instance drops it from `self.capabilities` so runtime resolution
    rejects the call.
