"""
e2e-suite conftest.

Forces an active enterprise license for the entire e2e session so that
RBAC tests covering custom roles, groups, LDAP, audit logs etc. exercise
the real enterprise codepaths instead of skipping. Without this, every
test that calls ``_requires_enterprise()`` (or hits a route guarded by
``@require_enterprise``) skips because the dev environment has no
license key configured.

The license layer caches its result in module-level globals
``_cached_license`` / ``_cache_initialized`` (see app/ee/license.py).
Setting them once at session start makes ``get_license_info()``,
``has_feature()`` and ``is_enterprise_licensed()`` all report enterprise
without us having to monkey-patch each entry point individually.

Tests that intentionally exercise the community-mode branch (e.g.
test_rbac.py::test_create_custom_role_enterprise_gate) still work — the
``if is_enterprise_licensed()`` branches just always pick the licensed
arm, which is the more thorough one.
