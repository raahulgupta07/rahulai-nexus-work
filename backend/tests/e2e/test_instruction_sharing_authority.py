"""Regression: cross-agent authority for shared instructions in the automation plane.

A shared instruction is a single row loaded by every agent it is attached to.
Promoting a change to it makes that change live for ALL attached agents. Authority
is resolved per-agent, so the Self-Learning automation plane must NOT auto-promote
a suggestion touching a shared instruction unless EVERY affected agent's policy
independently consents (mode auto_approve / eval_auto). Ported from PR #732.

Scenario (the reported design issue): instruction1 is attached to agent1 AND
agent2. A manager controls only agent2 and sets its policy to auto_approve. A
suggestion build touching instruction1 must not go live org-wide off agent2's
policy alone — that would break agent1.
