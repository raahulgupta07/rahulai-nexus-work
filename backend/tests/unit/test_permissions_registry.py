    ★The name of this test used to be `..._only_data_source_in_mvp`, and it was
    already wrong twice over: `connection` was added and the assertion updated,
    then `project` was added and it was not — so the test failed and read as a
    product bug. The list is the point, not the number two.

    Extend this deliberately when a kind is added, having answered: does it need
    an entry in `RESOURCE_SCOPED_GROUPS`, and should it appear in the role
    editor? `project` needs neither — its grants are written by the sharing UI —
    and that is exactly the kind of thing worth recording once.
