"""Per-user (overlay) schema context: enrichment, and what must not cross over.

The overlay decides WHICH tables and columns a user may see. The canonical
catalog describes WHAT they are. Column descriptors were previously nulled for
overlay users, so measures lost their identity and hidden join keys lost their
flag for exactly the deployments that use per-user credentials.

Enriching from the canonical row fixes that, but the canonical row was indexed
by a system identity with broader reach — so these tests pin both halves: the
structural facts DO cross, and people/artefact metadata and unreachable join
targets do NOT.
