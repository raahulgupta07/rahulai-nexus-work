"""Regression tests for cron day-of-week handling.

Standard cron numbers weekdays 0=Sun..6=Sat, but APScheduler's numeric
day_of_week is 0=Mon..6=Sun. Feeding the raw number to APScheduler shifted
every weekday by one (a Sunday "0" task fired on Monday). We translate the
day-of-week to APScheduler's weekday NAMES at registration time; the stored
cron string stays in standard convention. These tests pin both the translation
and the resulting real fire day.
