"""Remove deep analytics mode.

Deep mode is gone: the UI no longer offers it and the API schemas no longer
accept it. Rows still carrying ``mode='deep'`` have to be rewritten before the
tightened ``Literal``s in ``report_schema`` / ``webhook_schema`` see them —
those are *response* models, so a single stale row would 500 the whole
``GET /reports`` list, not just the one conversation.

Ordering matters. Prompts and webhooks are the generators: a scheduled prompt
or a trigger with ``mode='deep'`` stamps that mode onto every report it spawns
(``prompt_service._create_report_for``, ``webhook_service`` trigger spawn). So
they are rewritten FIRST — cleaning ``reports`` while a schedule can still fire
leaves the table dirty again minutes later.

Instructions are a separate case. ``_passes_mode_channel`` already tolerates an
unknown mode in the list, so ``['chat','deep']`` keeps matching chat; only a
``['deep']``-ONLY instruction breaks (it silently matches nothing). Those map to
``['chat']`` rather than ``[]``, because ``[]`` means "all modes" — stripping to
empty would promote a narrowly-scoped instruction into a globally-active one.

``instruction_versions`` is deliberately NOT rewritten: build_service diffs
``applicable_modes`` between versions to compute changed_fields, so editing
history would make every historical version register as changed.
