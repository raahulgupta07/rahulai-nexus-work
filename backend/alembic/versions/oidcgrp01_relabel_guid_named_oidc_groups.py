"""Relabel OIDC-synced groups whose name is just their raw directory GUID

Revision ID: oidcgrp01
Revises: dpanl0001
Create Date: 2026-08-07

Group sync writes one BOW ``Group`` per id in the OIDC ``groups`` claim, and
asks Graph for a display name. Not every id resolves: directory roles and
administrative units arrive through the same claim, and a tenant can withhold
individual groups from the app registration — ``getByIds`` simply omits those.

The Graph helper used to backfill each unresolved id with the id itself, so an
unreadable object was indistinguishable from a real name, and the group landed
in the admin's list as a bare ``85f43b45-99ae-43a0-a780-a05c119e8b9c`` sitting
next to properly named ones. The sync path now labels unresolved ids, but rows
already written keep the GUID until the member next signs in. This relabels
them in place so the existing list reads correctly right away.

Deliberately narrow — a row is touched only when all three hold:

  - it is OIDC-synced (``external_provider = 'oidc'``),
  - its ``name`` is *exactly* its ``external_id`` (so a group genuinely renamed
    by an admin, or one Graph resolved, is never rewritten), and
  - that id is GUID-shaped (providers that emit readable claim values — Okta,
    Keycloak, Entra configured for sAMAccountName — are left alone; there the
    name and the id being equal is correct).

Data-only and idempotent: a relabelled row no longer matches the predicate.
Downgrade restores the GUID name for exactly the rows this touched.

★Fork note: upstream revises ``evsuite0002``. This fork's graph is different —
its single head is ``dpanl0001`` — so ``down_revision`` is re-pointed there.
Copying upstream's parent would create a second head and break
``alembic upgrade head`` on every install.
