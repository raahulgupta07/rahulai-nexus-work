"""add source_connection_id / source_ref to files

Revision ID: connfile01
Revises: syncruns01
Create Date: 2026-08-03 10:00:00.000000

Connector files are a CACHE of a remote file, not an upload, but nothing on the
row said WHICH remote file — so every read minted a fresh File row and a fresh
copy on disk, none of them linked to the report. These two columns give the
cache a key: refresh the existing row for a (report, connection, ref) instead
of accumulating duplicates.

NULL for uploads, which have no remote counterpart.

# ★Re-chained. Upstream puts this after `licui0001`, the migration that creates
# their enterprise license-key `instance_settings` table. This fork removed
# licensing deliberately AND already owns a table of that name with a different
# shape (single row + `config` JSON, for SSO — migration 3432b52b6d20), so
# taking licui0001 would fail on "relation already exists". Skipping it removes
# the collision entirely; this simply chains onto our own head instead.
