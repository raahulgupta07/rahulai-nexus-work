Agent focus: a JSON list on reports naming the subset of attached agents
(data sources) whose FULL schema is rendered into the planner context. When
an org has many agents, the planner shows a thin roster of all attached agents
and full schema only for the focused subset (auto-seeded from per-user usage or
narrowed via the set_report_agents tool / prompt-box focus selector).

# ★FORK: upstream anchors this on `fccfb9232670`, a no-op merge revision this
# fork deliberately never took — see the docstring in
# svr0001_step_user_results_run_identity.py, which re-points onto `fastq002` for
# the same reason. Re-anchored on our head so the chain resolves; upstream's
# branch-and-merge SHAPE is preserved (rsgrp0001 forks off the same point and
# 297905a87c8a merges both), which keeps their revision ids usable next port.
