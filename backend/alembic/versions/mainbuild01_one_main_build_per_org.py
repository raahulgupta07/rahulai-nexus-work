"""enforce a single main instruction build per organization

Revision ID: mainbuild01
Revises: idxuser01
Create Date: 2026-07-26

★ Fork re-point. Upstream ships this and `idxuser01` both revising
`entraprof01`, which leaves two heads and makes upstream's own
`alembic upgrade head` refuse to run. Chained onto `idxuser01` here so the
fork's history stays a single line. The repair step and the index are unchanged
from upstream; on this installation the repair is a no-op (checked: no org has
more than one live is_main build).

`instruction_builds.is_main` marks the live instruction set — the build every
read path resolves against. The "only one per organization" rule was documented
on the model and implemented in `promote_build`, but nothing at the database
level enforced it, so two promotions racing inside one org (a user instruction
save finalizing while a training session or git sync promoted its own build)
could leave two rows flagged is_main. That state hard-broke the org: readers
used `scalar_one_or_none()`, which raises MultipleResultsFound, so
`GET /instructions` 500'd ("Failed to load instructions"), the badge counts
500'd, and the agent's instruction context failed to load.

This migration repairs any org already in that state (keeping the newest build
as main and demoting the rest) and then adds a partial unique index so the
duplicate cannot be created again. Both SQLite and PostgreSQL support partial
indexes; a plain unique index on is_main would be wrong (many builds legitimately
share is_main=False).
