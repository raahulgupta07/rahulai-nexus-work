"""Give a test suite an optional home agent (per-agent Drafts bucket)

Revision ID: evsuite0001
Revises: dpanl0001
Create Date: 2026-08-07

The default "Drafts" suite is per-organization, so in an org with many agents it
becomes one shared pile holding every agent's auto-drafted cases. It is also
mixed by construction, which made it unrunnable: running a suite requires
authority over every case in it, and a shared bucket always contains someone
else's.

``data_source_id`` is a HOME, not a scope — it says where new cases land by
default and lets an EMPTY per-agent Drafts be found at all (with no cases, there
is nothing to derive the agent from). It does not constrain what a case in the
suite may target, and suite authority still derives from the cases held. NULL is
the org-wide suite, which is what every existing row becomes.

# ★Re-pointed from upstream's 'dpanl0001' onto our head 'bcbase001'.
# Upstream lands the Deep Analytics removal first; this fork ports the eval
# work first, because the deep removal has an ordering constraint of its own
# (the frontend sanitizer must ship BEFORE the data rewrite, or the mode picker
# writes 'deep' straight back). The two are independent — dpanl0001 only
# UPDATEs `mode`/`applicable_modes` on reports, prompts, webhooks and
# instructions, while this one only adds test_suites.data_source_id — so the
# order between them carries no meaning. dpanl0001 is chained onto evsuite0002
# when it lands, keeping a single linear head.
