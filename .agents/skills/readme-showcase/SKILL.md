description: Build or refresh a product README showcase using a seeded CityAgent Insights workspace, polished in-product screenshots, and repository-ready visual assets. Use when positioning has changed, README screenshots are stale, a launch/demo workspace is needed, or the user asks to populate agents, reports, dashboards, evals, automations, connectors, or monitoring for product storytelling.

# README Showcase

Create a credible demo workspace first, then capture the product as it actually
works. Treat the README copy, seeded state, and screenshots as one deliverable.

## Ground Rules

- Read `.agents/skills/ui-evidence/SKILL.md` before capturing product screens.
- Use only seeded, synthetic, sample, or explicitly approved demo data. Never
  capture customer data, credentials, tokens, or raw API keys.
- If an external LLM will receive local data, state that clearly and obtain
  explicit approval before running the analysis. A pasted API key is not a
  substitute for informed data-sharing approval.
- Give demo users plausible names and roles. Avoid labels such as `admin`,
  `test`, or `demo user` in final screenshots.
- Preserve the product UI pixels. Generate backgrounds separately and compose
  screenshots deterministically; never ask an image model to redraw UI text.

## Workflow

### 1. Define the Story

Read the current README and list the product claims each screenshot must prove.
For the current product direction, cover:

- Bring any LLM and connect any data.
- Agentic analytics: reports, dashboards, query generation, deep analysis, and
  root-cause analysis.
- Data agents with scoped data, tools, credentials, instructions, permissions,
  starters, and channels.
- Automations, schedules, and event-driven triggers.
- Evals, LLM-as-judge checks, and self-improving instruction loops.
- Full run observability: traces, plans, tool calls, costs, latency, feedback,
  and reliability diagnosis.
- MCP gateway, connectors, RBAC, and enterprise governance.

Write the desired screenshot list before seeding. Prefer eight strong scenes:

1. Executive dashboard open beside its conversation.
2. Root-cause analysis conversation.
3. Agents overview showing several distinct domains.
4. Pending instruction change or build review.
5. Eval-driven self-learning settings.
6. Connector catalog.
7. Automation trigger or scheduled task.
8. Monitoring with traces and judge/reliability signals.

### 2. Build the Demo Workspace

Inspect available sample databases before inventing data. Connect two to four
varied foundations, then create domain agents that reflect real ownership
boundaries rather than duplicate assistants. A strong enterprise set includes
System Logs, Sales, Finance, Procurement, Workforce, Executive Operations, and
Customer Analytics.

For every agent:

- Select only the relevant connections and tables.
- Add a concise description, context, operating instruction, and four starters.
- Configure channels and an appropriate production/training status.
- Use distinct icons and clean names.
- Add eval cases that test calculations, evidence, tool use, and decision quality.

Seed enough state to make every target screen real: reports, one polished page
artifact, an RCA, an eval suite, a pending build, self-learning policy, a
trigger or schedule, and monitoring traces/results. Prefer product APIs over
direct database writes. Use local deterministic seeding only when external
inference is not approved or a repeatable fixture is required, and disclose it.

### 3. Capture Clean Product States

Use Playwright through `tools/agent/capture.mjs` or a task-specific derivative
that writes PNG files directly. Keep one signed-in demo context and a consistent
`1600x900` viewport. Set `deviceScaleFactor: 2` for showcase work so every raw
capture is a true `3200x1800` PNG. Do not use an in-app browser screenshot when
that path returns JPEG bytes or otherwise re-encodes the page.

Open each target scene in a fresh page within the authenticated context. This
avoids carrying reactive route, modal, or transition state from one screenshot
into the next. Wait for network activity, fonts, charts, and the scene's focal
element before capturing. Do not disable animations in the screenshot call when
doing so changes backdrop or view-transition rendering; wait for the UI to
settle instead.

Before each capture:

- Close unrelated menus and transient notifications.
- Ensure titles, labels, and table contents are readable.
- Check that no text is clipped and no fixed element overlaps the focal area.
- Keep the active navigation item visible where it adds context.
- Verify the screen contains no secret, email beyond the demo identity, or
  unapproved local data.

Inspect every raw screenshot at original resolution before composition. Verify
the file signature as well as the extension: PNG begins with
`89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a`.

### 4. Add Painted Backdrops

Use image generation for two or three coordinated, wide natural or abstract
paintings. Ask for a quiet low-contrast center, richer edge detail, off-white
paper texture, and a restrained multi-color palette. Exclude text, logos,
gradient shapes, bokeh, and UI elements.

Place each untouched product screenshot over a backdrop with:

- A fixed 16:9 final canvas, normally `2400x1350`.
- A product frame that occupies roughly 90-94% of the canvas width.
- A subtle white edge, 6-8px corner radius, and restrained shadow.
- No labels or decorative UI outside the product screenshot.

Compose with a lossless image pipeline such as Sharp and write the final PNG
directly. Never load the composition into a browser and screenshot it again.
Avoid alpha-mask operations that alter flat UI layers; compare the composed
image against the raw capture and use a square or minimally rounded frame when
that preserves pixels more reliably.

Store final assets under `media/readme/final/`. Prefer readable UI over an
arbitrary file-size ceiling; a polished `2400x1350` PNG may reasonably be 1-4
MB. Keep raw captures and generated backgrounds outside the repo unless the user
explicitly asks for source assets.

### 5. Update the README

Keep the writing direct and product-specific. Lead with the product and the
literal value, not category jargon. Preserve useful integration tables and
replace stale images in place.

Recommended narrative order:

1. Positioning and executive dashboard.
2. Chat, deep analysis, and RCA.
3. Agent context and agents-at-scale management.
4. Automations and channels.
5. Evals, self-learning, and monitoring.
6. Architecture, LLM providers, data connectors, MCP, and enterprise controls.

Use descriptive alt text and repository-relative image paths. Do not leave the
same screenshot in multiple sections unless it is intentionally the hero.

## Verification

- Run `git diff --check`.
- Confirm every README image path exists.
- Confirm raw and final assets are real PNG files and dimensions are consistent.
- Visually inspect every final image at original resolution.
- Check `git status --short --untracked-files=all` and keep only intended README
  and `media/readme/final/` changes.
- Leave the local app open on the strongest showcase screen and report the URL.
- Tell the user when external LLM runs were replaced with local deterministic
  demo content, and recommend rotating any key pasted into chat.
