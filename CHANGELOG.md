# Release Notes

## Version 0.0.489.6 (July 27, 2026)
- **A brand-new installation reported two fatal errors on its very first start** — the application runs four server processes, and on an empty database all four tried to create the scheduler's bookkeeping table at the same moment. One succeeded; two were killed by the resulting conflict and printed a full error report ending in "Application startup failed. Exiting." They were restarted automatically a few seconds later and everything worked from then on, because the table existed by that point — but a first-time installer's first look at the log was two fatal-looking failures, and for those seconds the application served on half its processes. The table is now created by one process at a time, so a first start is silent. Only ever affected the first start against an empty database; an existing installation was never impacted.

## Version 0.0.489.5 (July 27, 2026)
- **A browser could stay on the old interface forever after an upgrade** — one machine kept showing the previous version while a different browser, on the same address, showed the new one immediately. The cause is a service worker: a small script a website can install to answer requests from its own local cache. This application has never installed one, but anything else previously served from the same address can, and it keeps running afterwards, intercepting every request. A hard-refresh does not help, because that bypasses the browser's cache and not the worker. The application now removes any such worker it finds on its own address when it starts, clears what it cached, and reloads once — so an affected browser repairs itself on the next visit instead of needing someone talked through developer tools.
- **Rolling back could never work on a first upgrade** — the rollback command looked for its target by name, deriving that name from the version currently running. But the saved image is named after the release it was saved *from*, so the name it searched for only exists after a second upgrade. Anyone rolling back their first upgrade was told no rollback image existed, while the correct one sat right there. It now identifies the target by reading the version out of each saved image rather than trusting the name, reports which version it is about to restore, and refuses only when every candidate is the version already running.
- **The upgrade guide covers reverse proxies** — the entry page must never be cached and the versioned assets must always be, and a proxy that gets this backwards produces exactly the frozen-interface symptom above with no error anywhere. The guide now gives the rule, the one-line check for what a proxy is really returning, and the settings for Caddy, nginx and Cloudflare.

## Version 0.0.489.4 (July 27, 2026)
- **Upgrading is now one command** — moving a running installation to a new release was an eight-step checklist, and four of those steps failed silently: skipping the database dump, skipping the rollback image tag, skipping the cache-buster that makes the new interface actually ship, and skipping the check that the build took at all. None of them produce an error; each one looks exactly like success until the day it matters. Two working images were lost this way. `./upgrade.sh` now performs the whole sequence and treats each of those four as a hard gate, stopping rather than continuing past a failed check. `./preflight.sh` reports the state of an installation without changing anything — version from all three places it can disagree, configuration, health, migration position, disk and backups — which is also the right thing to attach to a support request.
- **A fresh installation no longer starts by guessing** — there was no example configuration file, so a new install began by reading source code to find out which values were required. There is one now, and it opens with the setting that cannot be recovered if it is wrong: the encryption key that protects every stored credential is generated once and must never change afterwards. Left empty, the application does not fail — it quietly mints a new key at every restart, so each restart orphans what the previous run encrypted, with nothing to indicate anything is wrong.
- **The What's New window no longer links out to another project's releases** — the footer carried a link to the public releases page of the open-source project this product is built on. Anyone who followed it saw a different name and version numbers that never match ours. The changelog you are reading now is complete on its own, so the link is gone rather than replaced.

## Version 0.0.489.3 (July 27, 2026)
- **A dashboard can no longer be built on part of its data** — query results are capped so a table preview stays readable and the model's context stays affordable, but a dashboard was being built from that same shortened copy. Because the rows are cut in the query's own order, a month-ordered result quietly lost its most recent months: one dashboard reported net sales of 56.4B against a true 98.9B and covered ten of seventeen months with nothing to say so. Building from incomplete data is now refused outright, and the agent is told to summarise the data first rather than discovering the problem after it has already drawn the charts.
- **Charts get a wider allowance than tables** — a table on screen is unreadable past a few hundred rows while a chart is comfortable with tens of thousands, so these now have separate limits. A dashboard whose data fits the larger allowance is built from all of it and needs no summarising at all; in testing this halved the time to build one.
- **A dashboard that does not compile is never saved** — generated dashboards were stored without anyone checking they worked, so a broken one reached the screen as "Dashboard failed to render". Each dashboard is now compiled before it is stored, using the same compiler the browser uses; the error is handed back for correction, and if it still fails nothing is saved and the reason is reported honestly.
- **Every dashboard now explains itself** — a new panel above the tiles gives the headline and a few findings in plain language: which way the numbers are moving, what is concentrated where, and anything that stands out. Every figure in it is checked against the dashboard's own data before it is saved, and any figure that cannot be traced back is dropped rather than shown. This follows a summary during testing that reported an average order value of 11,499 when the true figure was 11,488.57 — right-looking, confidently stated, and traceable to nothing.

## Version 0.0.489.2 (July 26, 2026)
- **Members could see administration screens** — the Settings area showed a member the People and Members pages, which list every person in the organization with their email, role, linked sign-in providers and join date, and the sidebar offered them an "Admin" entry that opened it. Those pages are administration screens and now require the settings permission, as do the two endpoints behind them, so hiding the tab is backed by the server refusing the request rather than by the menu alone. Members no longer have a Settings area at all.
- **Local Runtime moved into Account Settings** — pairing your own computer is a personal action, not an organization setting, so it now sits in Account Settings beside your profile, usage and appearance rather than in the Settings area. The old address still works.

## Version 0.0.489.1 (July 26, 2026)
- **Power BI could answer with a confidently wrong number** — Power BI's query service silently returns only part of a large table: it stops at 100,000 rows, and sooner than that when rows are wide, without any warning that the result is incomplete. A question that pulled a table and then did the arithmetic here was therefore working from a fraction of the data. Asked for the top 5 promotion codes by benefit amount, the agent answered 518,000 for the wrong code while the true figure was 78,558,000 — the sum was calculated perfectly, over 16% of the table. Partial results are now detected and refused rather than used, and the agent asks Power BI to do the totalling and ranking, which is both correct and roughly a third faster. This does not affect connectors that read from a database directly, such as Microsoft Fabric, which return every row.
- **Analysis run on your own device could use a cut-off result** — when the local runtime executes analysis on your laptop, results above its size cap were trimmed on the way through. The trimming was already reported, but the helper on the laptop ignored the notice and used the shortened data anyway. It now stops with an explanation instead. Requires the updated helper.
- **A question answered twice showed both answers as current** — when the agent recomputed the same thing during a single turn, each attempt was kept as an equally valid result, so a chat could end up displaying several contradictory totals under one title with nothing to say which was the live one. Earlier attempts are now marked as replaced, and the agent is told plainly not to reconcile or average them. Nothing is deleted — the earlier attempts stay visible so the change can still be explained.
- **The answer sometimes left out the numbers** — a completed analysis could be summarised as "the analysis is done" with the figures only in the table beside it. The guidance against inventing data was being read as a reason to omit real results too. Those are now clearly separated: computed figures belong in the answer, invented ones never do.
- **A failing edit reported the wrong reason** — when editing a document or note failed, the real explanation (for example, that the text to replace was not found) was discarded and replaced by an internal message about output formats, which the agent could not act on. The true reason now survives.
- **A dashboard could be built on part of its data** — a saved analysis holds up to a set number of rows, and a dashboard built from it treated that portion as the whole dataset, reporting totals that were short and covering fewer months than they appeared to. Partial data is now declared, and anything built from it says so instead of presenting the shortfall as a total.
- **Exported PDFs printed placeholder text where charts belong** — a document exported to PDF showed raw markers instead of its charts. Charts still cannot be drawn in a server-side PDF, but the export now says so in place of each one rather than printing internal text.

## Version 0.0.489 (July 26, 2026)
- **New connector: Priority ERP** — connect a Priority Software installation (cloud or on-premise) and query its forms like any other data source. Three ways to sign in: a Personal Access Token (recommended, and the only one that works everywhere), a dedicated API user, or — on-premise only — "Sign in with Priority" so each member reaches exactly the forms their own Priority account allows. The connector catalogs *forms* rather than tables, keeps each field's Priority title so the agent sees the names your staff use rather than internal codes, and follows subforms as joins. Priority's cloud service allows 100 calls a minute per user, so a matching rate limit is set by default and can be raised for on-premise installations, which have no such ceiling.
- **New chat channel: Google Chat** — ask the agent questions from a Google Chat space and get the answer back in the thread. Events arrive over your own Google Cloud project, so no public URL is required.
- **Slack now connects without a public URL** — new Slack setups use Socket Mode by default, an outbound connection from the app to Slack, so there is nothing to expose to the internet and no signing secret to manage. Existing Slack connections keep working exactly as they are. Slack conversations also gained suggested prompts, a native "is thinking…" indicator, and proper threading.
- **Chat replies could be dropped, and the ✅ could appear before the answer** — on Slack, Teams, WhatsApp and Google Chat, the task that delivered a message could be collected by the system before it finished sending, and the "done" reaction was applied without waiting for the reply to land. Both are fixed across all four channels.
- **Quota exhaustion is now told apart from rate limiting** — both usually arrive as the same "429" from the provider, but they need opposite responses: a rate limit clears in seconds and is worth retrying, while an exhausted quota or empty credit balance will not clear during the run and needs a different model. The two are now distinguished, so a run that hits a spent balance switches models instead of retrying into the same wall. Your organization's own monthly spend limits are deliberately excluded — those mean *you* have hit your budget, and quietly moving the work to another model would only spend it somewhere else.
- **Word and PowerPoint files are no longer rejected for being short** — the check that spots an unreadable scanned PDF was also applied to Word and PowerPoint, whose text is read exactly. A genuinely brief document, such as a one-line memo, was treated as a failed read.
- **Reloading tables can no longer shrink the shared table list to one person's view** — when a reload runs with a member's own sign-in rather than the organization's credentials, it sees only the tables that member can reach. Such a reload now only ever *adds* to the shared list and never removes from it. This applies to the Microsoft Fabric and Power BI per-member sign-in connectors, where every reload runs as the member.
- **Faster sign-in sync on Fabric and Power BI** — revoking access to many tables at once no longer issues one database query per table.
- Documents can now be converted for preview inside the application, and several Microsoft Graph, Entra sign-in and MCP identity fixes ship alongside.

## Version 0.0.486.13 (July 26, 2026)
- **Microsoft Fabric and Power BI agents showed "No primary instruction" even though they had one** — those two connectors sign each member in with their own Microsoft account, so each member's Learn produces their own overview built from the tables they can see. The agent page was looking for a single shared overview, which those agents deliberately never have, so it reported nothing. The page now shows you your own overview, labelled so it is clear other members see theirs rather than yours.
- **Re-learning an agent could not repair a missing overview** — if an agent had no primary instruction, every subsequent Learn refreshed the text but never pointed the agent at it, so the page kept saying there was none. Learn now fills a missing primary. An overview you chose yourself is never overwritten.
- **A private overview could be published to the whole organization by accident** — when an agent had no primary, the system promoted the most likely instruction it could find, and a member's private overview was exactly the kind it preferred. Private instructions are now never promoted, and choosing one by hand is refused with an explanation.
- **One member's private overview could be shown to another member** during the agent setup step. It is now scoped to its owner.
- **Built-in connector skills are no longer promoted to primary** — they are generic advice for a connector type and say nothing about your data, so they made a poor description of the agent.

## Version 0.0.486.12 (July 26, 2026)
- **New Access page: decide what your members can reach** — shared folders, API keys and the MCP server can now each be set to one of three states from Settings ▸ Access. **On** means members use it normally. **Coming soon** leaves it visible but not usable, with a "Coming soon" label, so people can see it is planned instead of asking whether it exists. **Off** removes it from the interface entirely. All three start switched off, so a new installation exposes none of them until you decide otherwise.
- **Switching something off never destroys it** — API keys, MCP tokens and paired computers are all kept while a feature is off and work again the moment you switch it back on. Anyone who already has an API key can still revoke it while the feature is off, because taking a key away should never be blocked.
- **API keys could not be restricted before** — every member could create one and there was no setting anywhere to prevent it. They are now off unless you turn them on.
- **The switch is the real lock, not just a hidden menu** — turning a feature off also stops it working over the API, so a member cannot reach it by other means simply because a tab is no longer displayed.

## Version 0.0.486.11 (July 26, 2026)
- **A lakehouse that doesn't answer no longer disappears from your agent** — when your Microsoft account was re-checked, every lakehouse was contacted in turn and anything that failed to reply was quietly skipped. The tables in it were then treated as tables you had lost access to, and removed. A single slow or unavailable lakehouse could therefore empty a large part of your agent until the next fully successful check, with nothing to explain where the tables went. Tables are now only removed when the lakehouse holding them actually answered and no longer lists them, which is the only case that genuinely means your access changed.
- **Signing in to Microsoft Fabric is faster** — your lakehouses were contacted strictly one after another, so the wait was the sum of all of them. They are now contacted at the same time, and the wait is closer to the slowest single one. On an account with four lakehouses this part of sign-in went from about six and a half seconds to three.
- **Built-in Fabric guidance no longer refers to one customer's tables** — the three guides that ship with the app used real table and column names from the system they were written on. Since every person signs in with their own Microsoft account and sees a different set of tables, those examples meant nothing to anyone else. Every example now uses neutral placeholder names meant to be read as "your table here".

## Version 0.0.486.10 (July 26, 2026)
- **Questions that span two Fabric lakehouses now run as one query** — the connector refused any question that touched more than one lakehouse and fell back to pulling every table into memory and joining them there, which on the larger tables meant millions of rows moved for a result of a few dozen. Fabric can in fact join across lakehouses that live in the same workspace, so those questions are now sent to Fabric as a single query and come back in seconds. Lakehouses in genuinely different workspaces still can't be joined in one query — that is a Fabric limit, not ours — but the message now tells you which of your lakehouses *can* be joined together instead of only saying no.
- **The assistant now ships with built-in Fabric know-how** — three short guides, written from Microsoft's own documentation, covering the ways Fabric's SQL differs from the SQL most people expect: text comparisons are case-sensitive by default, the keys declared on a table are not enforced and so don't prove a join is valid, and a number of familiar commands and data types simply aren't available. The assistant reads a guide only when the question calls for it, so they cost nothing on unrelated work. They arrive automatically once a Fabric connection is set up, are marked "Built-in" in the knowledge area, and can be archived if you don't want one used.
- **A wrong join between two product codes has been removed, and the check that missed it added** — the automatically written summary of your Fabric data claimed two product-code columns could be joined. They share no values whatsoever: different code formats, in different workspaces, so the join was not merely wrong but impossible. Because that summary is included with every question, the claim was steering answers. Claims like it are now measured against the actual data before being stored, and one that turns out to have no overlap is labelled as such rather than passed on as fact.
- **A generated summary can no longer arrive as raw code** — the step that tidies up the assistant's written summary of a data source only trimmed formatting marks from the beginning of the text, so one left at the end caused the whole summary to be stored as unreadable machine output. Marks at both ends are now removed.
- **Reference material is available during deep analysis and training** — the assistant was shown the list of available guides in every mode but could only open one while in chat, so during a long analysis it could see what existed and not read it. It can now open them wherever they are listed.

## Version 0.0.486.9 (July 26, 2026)
- **Live updates in chat can no longer go missing** — the messages that push each new answer block into your browser were started as background work that the system only held on to loosely, so one could be discarded part-way through and simply never arrive. Nothing was logged when it happened, which is why it read as an occasional glitch rather than a fault. Those updates are now held until they finish. The same protection covers the notifications sent out to chat channels.
- **Answers sent to a chat channel no longer arrive empty** — when an answer was delivered to Slack or Teams, an internal filter meant to hide setup steps was written in a way that quietly discarded every ordinary step as well. On top of that, the delivery could start reading the answer before it had finished being written down. Both are fixed, so a delivered answer now contains what it should.
- **Signing in with a company account keeps your access token fresh** — the token stored when you connect a Microsoft or Google account was only ever written the first time you signed in, so anything that used it later (such as reading your job title and department from Entra ID) was working from a long-expired token. It is now refreshed on every sign-in.
- **Fixed an upgrade step that could not run on some installations** — a database change shipped in the previous release used a command that one supported database engine does not accept, so upgrading on that engine stopped at that point. The step now adapts to the engine in use.

## Version 0.0.486.8 (July 26, 2026)
- **Administrators can now switch Local Runtime off for the whole organisation** — until now the only way to remove the feature was an environment variable, which meant editing a file and redeploying; nobody inside the product could do it. It is now an ordinary setting that only an administrator can change. Turning it off stops all local execution immediately and hides the feature from members. Computers that were already paired are kept exactly as they are, so turning it back on restores them rather than making everyone pair again.
- **The MCP configuration now names this product** — the snippet you copy into your MCP client identified the server as "bagofwords", the name of the upstream open-source project, so it appeared in your client's server list under a product name you had never seen. It now reads "cityagent-insights".

## Version 0.0.486.7 (July 26, 2026)
- **"Run analysis on my computer" now starts switched off** — pairing your laptop and agreeing to run analyses on it are two different decisions, but the switch was on from the moment a device was paired, so a newly connected computer began executing work before anyone had seen the option. New devices now start off and you turn it on when you are ready. Computers already paired keep whatever setting they have — nothing is switched off behind your back.

## Version 0.0.486.6 (July 26, 2026)
- **Every settings tab is visible again** — the row of tabs across the top of Settings was a few pixels wider than the space it had, so the last tab was sliced off by the edge of the page. It was cut mid-word, and because it was the tab you were on, the one page you were looking at was the one whose name you could not read. Three of the longest tab names are now shorter — People, PII and Identity — and the spacing between them is slightly tighter, which leaves the whole row comfortably inside the page with room to spare for future tabs. Each page still shows its full name as the heading, so nothing is lost.
- **Running analyses on your own computer is now off unless it is switched on** — Local Runtime is disabled by default. Its settings tab, download links and pairing flow stay hidden until an administrator turns it on, so an organisation that doesn't use it is never shown a feature it didn't ask for.

## Version 0.0.486.5 (July 26, 2026)
- **Questions about files whose names contain spaces now work** — tables from a folder shared off your own computer take their names from the file names, so many of them contain spaces. When the analysis wrote one of those names into SQL without quotes, the database read the first word as the whole name and the question failed with "Table with name ... does not exist" — a file called "AWS Console Login events.csv" was looked up as "AWS". The rule for quoting these names is now stated up front, alongside the folder's table list, so the name is used whole.

## Version 0.0.486.4 (July 26, 2026)
- **Data previews no longer report a failure when they actually worked** — when the platform inspected your data, it kept a record of every attempt it made, including ones it had already corrected and moved past. The preview step then treated the presence of any such record as proof that it had failed. So a preview whose first attempt needed a correction was marked failed and given the discarded first error as its reason, even though the corrected attempt had run and its results were sitting right there in the output. Almost half of all previews were affected. The step now reports what actually happened, and the record of earlier attempts is kept for diagnosis only. Previews that genuinely fail are still reported as failures, unchanged. The same fault affected CSV exports and has been fixed there too.

## Version 0.0.486.3 (July 25, 2026)
- **Automatic model fallback now takes over when a model's endpoint cannot be reached** — with fallback switched on, an unreachable model was the one outage it never covered. The provider libraries report a dead endpoint, a wrong address and an expired certificate with the same three-word message, and the detail that distinguishes them was being dropped before the failure was assessed, so the platform filed it as "unrecognised" and surfaced a hard error to the user instead of moving the request to the next model in the list. Unreachable endpoints are now recognised, so the request is served by the next model and the substitution is disclosed in the chat as usual. Genuine key and permission problems still stop the run rather than quietly retrying elsewhere.
- **Analyses that read a folder shared from your device now show the queries they ran** — the query list came back empty for anything read directly from a shared folder, because those queries run on your machine and were never reported back. They now appear alongside server queries, so a folder analysis shows the same working detail as any other.
- **Better guidance when a folder analysis comes back empty** — an analysis that read your shared folder and returned nothing was told to check the table names of a completely unrelated connection, which sent the next attempt looking in the wrong place. It is now told what actually happened, and unrelated table names are no longer offered.

## Version 0.0.486.2 (July 25, 2026)
- **Analyses that used to fail two or three times before working now succeed on the first attempt** — after the model wrote the analysis code, a clean-up step trimmed anything that followed it by searching the text for the line that hands back the result. It stopped at the *first* one it found, which is usually inside a small helper near the top of the code, so the rest of the function — including the database queries — was thrown away before it ever ran. The run then failed with "returned None or an empty DataFrame". Whether a question worked came down to what the model happened to name one variable, which is why a retry sometimes succeeded for no visible reason. The clean-up now reads the generated code properly and keeps the whole function, so nothing inside it can be cut. Verified against the exact Power BI questions that were failing: both now succeed on the first attempt.
- **A run that is genuinely stuck now stops and says so, instead of retrying to no purpose** — if two attempts in a row produce identical code *and* an identical error, further attempts cannot add anything, so the run stops immediately and reports that it is stuck. An exact repeat like this usually means the cause is not in the generated code at all, so this also surfaces problems that would otherwise be silently burned through as retries. Attempts that produce genuinely different code are unaffected and still retry as before.
- **Error messages now describe what actually happened instead of guessing** — when an analysis returned no data, the message always told the model to check its table name, even when no query had been run at all, or when the queries had already succeeded and only the result was lost. It now reports what was observed: either that no query ran, or that the queries succeeded and the connection, credentials and SQL are all fine so the fault is elsewhere. The table-name hint appears only where it can actually apply.
- **Analyses that run on your own device now show which queries they used** — with the Local Runtime helper connected, the query list for a locally-executed analysis came back empty, because the queries ran on your machine and were never reported back. They are now included, so a local run shows the same detail as one that ran on the server.
- **The macOS helper app has been rebuilt** — the downloadable CityAgent Helper now includes the recent local-folder fixes: folders added or removed from the app are picked up without a restart, and un-sharing your last folder correctly clears it from the app instead of leaving it listed. Reading PDFs from a shared folder is now built into the app rather than depending on a Python package being present on your Mac. The helper also reports its version to the server, so a stale copy left running is now visible.

## Version 0.0.486.1 (July 25, 2026)
- **Power BI questions actually run now** — signing in to Power BI with your own Microsoft account loaded the dataset list correctly, but every question against it failed with an Azure AD error about a missing client secret. The query path was handed your stored sign-in record instead of a live access token, so it fell back to app-only authentication that this connector doesn't use. It now mints a fresh token from your sign-in, the same way Microsoft Fabric already did. Verified live: a real row count returned from a Power BI dataset, with Fabric unchanged.

## Version 0.0.486 (July 25, 2026)
Upstream release v0.0.486 ported onto the CityAgent Insights feature stack. All fork features (Local Runtime, local-folder attachments and chips, per-user Microsoft connectors, seeded agents, SSO/LDAP management, per-user instructions) verified unaffected.

- **A failed model no longer ends the run — it falls back to the next one** *(from v0.0.486)* — when the active model dies mid-run on a rate limit, a provider overload, or a network error, the run now retries on the next model in a configured **fallback order** and carries on for the rest of that run instead of stopping. The substitution is always disclosed in the chat: the step shows which model was dropped, which one took over, and why. A model that just failed is short-circuited for a cooldown so the same dead endpoint isn't tried again on every step. The order is set on the **LLM** settings page (up to 10 models), the feature is **off by default**, and it requires an enterprise license — routing and fallback are separate: routing picks the best model up front, fallback only reacts to a failure.
- **The agent can now read long dashboard code without burning the context window** *(from v0.0.486)* — `read_artifact` on a large artifact used to dump the whole file into the prompt. It now returns a line-numbered **outline** first, and the agent pulls exactly the part it needs with a line range (`offset`/`limit`) or a pattern search (`grep_pattern`, with surrounding context lines). Short artifacts are returned in full as before.
- **Tableau reloads reuse the indexed catalog instead of re-reading every datasource** *(from v0.0.486)* — the Tableau connector made two metadata calls for **every** published datasource on **every** refresh, so a site with hundreds of datasources paid a long crawl on each interactive "Reload tables". Tableau now uses the same incremental discovery already shipped for Power BI and Fabric: the cheap identity-scoped listing decides what you can see, known datasources are rebuilt from the stored catalog (with names, projects and paths refreshed so renames and moves still propagate), and only **new** datasources pay the per-datasource cost. Vanished datasources drop out, previously-unreadable ones are retried live, and scheduled/background reindexing keeps full introspection so field-level changes are still detected.
- **Closing a half-filled connection form now asks first** *(from v0.0.486)* — clicking outside the Add Connection dialog after typing credentials silently threw the form away. It now warns before discarding, so a long connector setup isn't lost to a stray click.

## Version 0.0.485.7 (July 25, 2026)
- **Local folders now carry documents, not just data files** — a connected folder lists its PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoints and text files alongside CSV/Excel tables. Attach the folder and ask about a document: the agent reads it through your paired helper, with the text extracted on your own device — the file is never uploaded. Folder rows show "N docs" instead of a misleading "no data files".
- **The helper download page now offers a build per operating system** — the Local Runtime settings page shows one card per platform (macOS and Windows) with its own download and setup hint, instead of a single macOS-only link.
- **A retried question no longer queries the wrong folders** — when a step failed and the agent retried, any mention of a folder inside the error text it echoed back was mistaken for a real folder selection, so the retry could be sent to your helper with a garbled folder list. Only genuine folder references count now.

## Version 0.0.485.6 (July 25, 2026)
- **Folder and file chips now actually show on chat messages** — the chat page renders messages with its own template, which never had the chips; they are now built directly into it. Every message shows a green chip per connected folder and a blue chip per uploaded file, live and after reload.

## Version 0.0.485.5 (July 25, 2026)
- **Attachment chips appear instantly on sent messages** — the folder and file chips now render on your message the moment you press send, not only after a page reload. The live message copy previously dropped the attachment info the server was already storing.

## Version 0.0.485.4 (July 25, 2026)
- **Uploaded files now show on chat messages** — every message displays a blue chip for each uploaded file it was asked against (documents were previously only tracked at the report level, so bubbles had nothing to show). Works from the landing page and inside reports.

## Version 0.0.485.3 (July 25, 2026)
- **Compact attach menu that can never clip** — the paperclip menu is now a ~290px Micro List: one-line folder rows (full path on hover), search on top, every folder in one scrolling list. It opens downward on the landing page and flips upward in chat automatically — Upload files is always visible on any screen size.

## Version 0.0.485.2 (July 25, 2026)
- **Attach menu always fits the screen** — the paperclip menu is now hard-capped to the window height: Upload files, search and the Connect button stay pinned and visible on any screen; only the folder list scrolls. Fixes the clipped menu where "Upload files" disappeared off the top.
- **Attachments visible in the chat** — every message shows what it was asked against: green chips for connected folders ("queried on your device"), blue chips for uploaded files, on old conversations too.
- **Folders truly stay with the conversation** — the attached folder follows from the landing page into the report, survives reloads, and is only detached when you remove its chip yourself.
- **The app announces new versions** — after a redeploy, open tabs show a "new version available" prompt with a one-click reload; no more stale pages.

## Version 0.0.485.1 (July 25, 2026)
- **Power BI (User Sign-in) and (Multi-Tenant) repeat sign-ins now take seconds, not minutes** — the multi-tenant scan reuses the saved catalog: each sign-in still asks Microsoft which datasets the person can see (permissions stay live, checked every time), but already-known datasets are rebuilt from the stored definitions and only newly-appeared ones are read in full. First-ever sign-in is unchanged, and any problem reading the saved catalog silently falls back to the previous full scan. Applies to both multi-tenant Power BI connectors; the original Power BI connector and Microsoft Fabric are untouched.

## Version 0.0.485 (July 25, 2026)
Upstream releases v0.0.483 → v0.0.485 ported onto the CityAgent Insights feature stack. All fork features (Local Runtime, per-user Microsoft connectors, seeded agents, SSO/LDAP management) verified unaffected.

- **Power BI indexing is dramatically faster** *(from v0.0.485)* — reloading a Power BI or Fabric connection now re-introspects only **new** datasets; already-indexed model tables are rebuilt from the stored catalog (upstream measured a 500-model tenant dropping from ~9 minutes to ~5 seconds). A manual Reload also no longer crawls the tenant twice: the catalog fetched with your own sign-in is reused for your personal table overlay in the same request — and it is only ever reused when it was fetched with **your** identity, never another user's. Scheduled background re-indexing still does a full crawl so column-level changes are always picked up. Internal `RowNumber-…` helper columns are now filtered out of every model table.
- **SharePoint, OneDrive and Google Drive can read documents** *(from v0.0.483)* — PDF, Word and PowerPoint files opened from drive connectors now return their extracted text to the agent (previously opaque bytes). Scanned/image-only PDFs fall back to raw bytes so vision can render them. Google-native Docs/Sheets/Slides export to PDF for original-file attachment. Extraction runs through the same hardened text layer as file uploads, including this fork's OOXML tag-scrub.
- **LLM judge cost guard** *(from v0.0.483)* — background quality scoring now runs only when the organization has a genuinely separate small model configured; it is never silently billed to the org's only (large) model.
- **Configurable agent limits** *(from v0.0.484)* — Settings gains **Max agent steps** (planner loop cap, 1–500) and an editable **Limit code retries** (codegen attempts, 1–10). The unused "Limit analysis steps" setting is removed, and settings sync now refreshes names/descriptions and prunes removed settings for existing organizations without touching stored values.
- **Honest catalog copy for non-SQL connectors** *(from v0.0.484)* — connection cards and indexing results now speak the connector's language: "Files" for drives, "messages" for mail, "model tables" for Power BI (applied to all three Power BI connector variants in this fork), "Collections" for document stores, "Tools" for MCP. Per-user catalogs (OneDrive, Google Drive, mail) explain that each user's items are indexed at sign-in instead of reporting "Discovered 0 tables".

## Version 0.0.482.2 (July 25, 2026)
- **Local Runtime (run agent analysis on your own computer)** — a paired **CityAgent Helper** on the user's laptop can now execute the agent's generated Python locally: the cloud still plans and writes the code, but the data crunching happens on the device. Pairing lives in **Settings → Local Runtime** (pair code, live online status, a "run on my computer" toggle, unpair). Jobs travel through a DB-backed queue (multi-worker safe, no websockets); credentials never leave the server — the helper proxies warehouse queries back through a server data-proxy endpoint with RBAC and a write-block. Any doubt (helper offline, unsupported job, timeout) falls back to the normal server sandbox so chat never breaks. Flag `HYBRID_LOCAL_RUNTIME`.
- **"Computed on your device" provenance badge** — every data step now shows where it actually ran: a green **Computed on your device** pill (with device name and elapsed time) when the local helper executed it, grey **Ran on server** otherwise. Provenance rides the existing step payload — no new tables, and users without a paired device see no change at all.
- **Attach a local folder in chat** — the paperclip menu gains **Attach local folder**: the helper scans shared folders (schema metadata only — table names, columns, row counts; file contents never uploaded) and the agent then queries those CSV/Parquet files **in place on the laptop** via DuckDB. Folder attachments are sticky across the conversation like data sources, work from the landing-page composer too (the folder rides into the new report's first message), and folder-reading steps are **forced local** — if the device is offline the agent says exactly which folder is unreachable and how to fix it, instead of silently answering from the wrong data. Flag `HYBRID_LOCAL_FOLDER_ATTACH`, migration `ca07lrfolders01`.
- **Helper apps for macOS and Windows** — the macOS menu-bar app (pair dialog, ●/⚡ status, Pause) is downloadable from Settings; the Windows tray app (`helper_app_win.py` + one-command PyInstaller build) is code-complete with full Windows compatibility fixes in the shared helper core (no `os.uname`, guarded chmod, UTF-8 console, POSIX paths for DuckDB). The settings page shows per-OS download cards and detects a missing build honestly (a real ranged-GET check, since the SPA catch-all would otherwise fake a 200).
- **Reliability fixes from live end-to-end testing** — CSV export of folder data no longer fails with "no device context" (the export tool now carries the same usage context as analysis steps, and a CSV produced on the laptop is materialized server-side from the returned dataframe); a retry that echoed a previous error message into the generated code can no longer garble the folder name sent to the helper (folder detection is anchored to real `ds_clients["local:…"]` references); and reports whose only data is an attached local folder no longer abort with "No active tables matched". Verified end-to-end on a real device: a 2,400-row local sales folder analyzed on-device in ~0.7s with results matching the raw file exactly.

## Version 0.0.482.1 (July 24, 2026)
- **Ready-to-use agents on every new installation** — the first admin signup now seeds three public agents automatically: **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI** (zero-config, each member connects their own Microsoft account via device code) and **City Mart Retail** (a full sample retail warehouse with 11 tables, teaching instructions and conversation starters). Once the admin saves the AI model key, any seeded agent still missing its overview learns itself in the background.
- **Onboarding now fits a pre-seeded workspace** — the welcome flow names the three ready agents and asks the admin for exactly one thing: the model key. Members never see setup screens they can't finish; they land straight on the workspace.
- **Learn controls on every agent** — the "Learn agent after saving" toggle and a new **Learn now** button appear on all connectors, not just the Microsoft ones. An explicit learn now publishes the overview immediately, makes it the agent's primary instruction, and de-duplicates conversation starters.
- **Faster uploads** — creating a Data Agent from files returns in under a second; the AI learning runs in the background and the wizard shows the draft as soon as it's ready.
- **Sign-in lifecycle for per-user connectors** — connection panels show signed-in / refreshed / expiry dates with a 90-day lifebar, a one-click **Reconnect** appears when the token expires, admins get a "Connected users" roster (no tokens ever shown), and Disconnect is scoped to the right credential store everywhere.
- **Single Sign-On made explicit** — Keycloak, Generic OIDC, Google and Entra ID are always listed with enable toggles; a provider can be switched on before it's configured, and its login button then explains "not available yet — ask your admin to finish setup" instead of failing mid-redirect.

## Version 0.0.482 (July 22, 2026)
- **Many-file agents no longer flood the context window** — the `<files>` section used to inline every attached file's full preview (sample rows, PDF text) into the planner prompt on every reasoning step, and the code-generation prompt carried the same previews twice; an agent whose file library holds dozens of files made every new chat pay ~7k tokens per wide spreadsheet with no cap and no trimming. Files now render at two tiers: files the user @-mentioned or attached with the current message keep their **full preview**, while files snapshotted from an agent's library render as a **one-line index** (type, row/column counts, sheet names, column headers) that the agent expands on demand with `read_file` / `inspect_data` — access is unchanged, only the eager prompt cost is gone. Remaining user uploads stay rich newest-first within a shared token budget (small chats with up to 3 files are untouched), the coder's `<excel_files>` block is now a stable index→file mapping instead of a second full copy, the Context Browser finally shows a `files` line item in the section-size breakdown, and the context trimmer can cut the files section as a backstop before it would ever touch conversation history or schemas. In a live test, a chat with six wide CSVs dropped from ~41k to ~1.6k tokens of file context with the model still answering file questions correctly from the index.

## Version 0.0.481 (July 22, 2026)
- **SAP BusinessObjects and SAP BW connectors (on-prem BI)** — two new data sources bring the on-prem SAP semantic layer into agents. **SAP BusinessObjects** connects over the `/biprws` RESTful Web Service SDK: it auto-discovers universes and their dimensions and measures, runs universe queries, and authenticates each end user by username/password (secEnterprise / LDAP / Active Directory / SAP) or by **trusted authentication** — a shared secret that logs a named user on **without their password**, the SSO-agnostic way to keep universe row/object security per user. **SAP BW / BW4HANA** connects over the XMLA web service (`/sap/bw/xml/soap/xmla`) and reuses the existing XMLA engine: it discovers InfoProviders and BEx queries as cubes (characteristics and key figures) and executes MDX — no proprietary RFC SDK and no OData "one structure" limit — with per-user Basic auth so BW analysis authorizations apply. Both index and query like any other source and reuse the platform's per-user credential storage; both show under **BI & analytics** with the SAP icon. Complements the existing SAP HANA (SQL) and SAP Datasphere (OData) connectors.

## Version 0.0.480 (July 21, 2026)
- **Forward per-user identity to MCP servers (#750)** — MCP connections can now map each signed-in user's identity and membership attributes into every tool call, both as outbound **HTTP headers** and as a **metadata object** merged into the tool arguments (`custom_metadata` by default), configured per-field in the connection's Advanced panel. Fields marked **locked** are injected server-side, always win over model-supplied values, and are stripped from the model-facing tool schema — so sensitive identity (e.g. `user_email`) can never be invented or overridden by the model; fields marked **ai** surface as defaults the model may fill. Also fixes a routing bug where an external MCP tool whose name collided with a BOW built-in (`create_report`, `get_context`, …) was silently intercepted and run in-process: a configured MCP/custom-API connection is now always called over its own wire, with genuine loopback self-calls detected and handled without deadlocking. MCP tool failures now render amber instead of red, and call durations round to whole seconds.

## Version 0.0.479 (July 21, 2026)
- **Word documents with tables no longer extract as raw XML** — the DOCX text scraper's regex matched `<w:tbl>`/`<w:tr>`/`<w:tc>` as text openers, so any docx containing a table (statements, invoices, most business docs) came back with WordprocessingML markup interleaved into its text everywhere extraction is used: `read_file`, keyword indexing, and content search. The tag match is now anchored, works with any XML namespace prefix (non-Microsoft generators emit e.g. `<ns0:t>`), and single-file **flat OPC / "Word 2003 XML"** documents saved with a `.docx` name — previously an unreadable dead end because they aren't zip archives — now extract their text too.

## Version 0.0.478 (July 21, 2026)
- **Garbled PDFs are now read as images instead of glyph soup** — PDFs with a broken/missing font-to-Unicode map (common in bank statements and other legacy-system exports) render perfectly on screen but extract as unreadable symbol salad, and `read_file` was returning that garbage as a successful text read. A new shape check (`doc_text_looks_garbled`) catches these extractions — letter-sparse, word-free text that no real document produces — and automatically re-reads the pages as images for a vision model, the same fallback scanned PDFs already use; prose in any script and numeric tables pass through untouched. The agent also gets an explicit `as_images` option on `read_file` so it can force an image read whenever text comes back mojibake'd (with the tool description now telling it to do exactly that instead of trusting the soup), and on non-vision models the garbled text is kept but flagged with a warning rather than presented as faithful. Garbled extractions no longer poison the keyword index or content search on Files & Directories and S3 sources — such files are indexed by name only — and the read cache is versioned so stale pre-fix text entries can't be served back.

## Version 0.0.477 (July 21, 2026)
- **Salesforce JWT Bearer OAuth + full object discovery (#751)** — the Salesforce connector authenticates a Connected App via the OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer flow (consumer key + certificate private key + username, no stored password or interactive login), and indexes every queryable standard and custom (`__c`) object instead of a fixed five. Sandbox and My-Domain logins now route correctly (`sandbox` → `test.salesforce.com`), reference fields become foreign keys in the schema, and SOQL results are capped at 10,000 rows.

## Version 0.0.476 (July 20, 2026)
- **Sync job info from Microsoft Entra ID into user context** — a new **Entra ID Profile Sync** section on Settings → Identity Providers lets an admin pull each signed-in user's Microsoft Graph `/me` profile (job title, department, company, office, and more) into their per-org context on login. The admin picks exactly which attributes are included via checkboxes that show **live sample values from their own profile**, and can add or remove attributes freely. Synced attributes are rendered to the agent inside the existing `<user_profile>` context block (treated as context, not instructions) and shown read-only under **Directory profile** in Account Settings. It's per-org and opt-in (stored in org settings, no bow-config change), and uses only the default-granted delegated **`User.Read`** scope — no admin consent required; the one lifecycle field that needs elevated access (`employeeLeaveDateTime`) is excluded from the allowlist. The SCIM and LDAP sections on the same page are now collapsible (collapsed by default).

## Version 0.0.475 (July 20, 2026)
- **SAP Datasphere connector (semantic layer)** — a new **SAP Datasphere** data source queries the Datasphere semantic layer over the OData Consumption API. It auto-discovers every consumption-exposed analytic model the caller can access via the catalog API, reads each model's `$metadata` to split columns into measures and dimensions, and runs server-side-aggregated analytical queries (measures aggregate over the dimensions the agent selects — no SQL, DAX, or MDX). Auth is dual-mode: a **Technical User** OAuth client (client credentials) drives discovery, indexing, and shared queries, while an optional per-user **Interactive** sign-in (authorization code) lets each user query as themselves so Datasphere's Data Access Controls (row-level security) apply — a DAC-protected model returns no rows to the technical user but full rows to an authorized user's own token. This is distinct from, and complementary to, the existing **SAP HANA** connector, which reaches Datasphere's raw SQL/Open-SQL views (flat tables) over the HANA SQL port rather than the governed analytic models.

## Version 0.0.474 (July 20, 2026)
- **PII is now masked in the live chat, not only after a refresh** — when PII protection is on, the message you just typed was rendered optimistically with its raw text and only flipped to `[REDACTED_…]` once the page was reloaded (the streaming path bypasses the display serializers that mask persisted rows). The completion stream's first event (`completion.started`) now carries the display-redacted prompt, and the report view patches the optimistic bubble in place the instant it arrives — so the masked value shows live, mid-stream, with no reload and no change to the send/stream flow. Enterprise-gated like the rest of PII protection; a no-op when the feature is off.

## Version 0.0.473 (July 20, 2026)
- **Image generation (OpenAI `gpt-image-1`)** — the agent can now generate images from a prompt via a new `generate_image` tool, backed by the OpenAI Images API. The result is stored as a file and can be embedded in dashboards. Image-generation is a new model capability (`supports_image_generation`) with `gpt-image-1` added to the preset catalog; admins can also mark any model as an image model via a new **Image gen** toggle in Settings → LLM (persisted across catalog re-syncs). Image models are excluded from the chat/agent model pickers and can never be set as the org's default or small-default model.
- **Embed images and PDFs in artifacts** — `create_artifact` / `edit_artifact` accept file ids (generated images, or uploaded images/PDFs) and render them on the dashboard canvas via a new `<BowFile>` component: images show inline, PDFs render inline in an in-sandbox pdf.js viewer (falling back to an "Open PDF" card where the viewer can't load), and annotations can be overlaid on either.
- **Generated images appear inline in the conversation** — the `generate_image` tool renders a spinner while running and the finished image inline in the chat. The image is associated with the report (so the agent can reference it on later turns via `<files>`, read it with `read_file`, and embed it with `create_artifact`/`edit_artifact`), but tagged to the completion so it stays out of the user's composer attachment tray. A context digest keeps its `file_id` visible in conversation history so "now put that image in a dashboard" works across turns.
- **Signed, revocable file serving for embeds** — embedded files are served via short-lived, file-scoped capability tokens (`/files/{id}/embed?token=…`) minted fresh at render time, instead of inlining bytes or exposing the session endpoint. This also makes embedded images/PDFs render on **published/shared reports** (`/r/{id}`) for non-authenticated viewers, scoped to files actually embedded in that report's artifacts.

## Version 0.0.472 (July 20, 2026)
- **Auto model router is now Enterprise-only** — the org router (Settings → LLM) is gated by a new `model_routing` license feature. On community/unlicensed builds the toggle stays visible but shows a locked **ENTERPRISE** badge and is disabled, enabling it via the API returns 402, and setting per-model routing guidance is rejected. Enforcement is layered: the completion resolver only routes when the license is active (fails closed, so a config left over from an active license can't keep routing), while turning the toggle **off** is always allowed so a lapsed license can't strand an org with routing stuck on. Community behavior is unchanged — the resolved default model always runs.
- **The answer's model badge reflects the model that actually ran** — a routed request starts on the small model, so its completion was stamped (and badged in the report view) with the small model even after the planner escalated and the stronger model did the work. The escalated model is now persisted onto the completion, so the icon, tooltip and provider glyph show the model that produced the answer.

## Version 0.0.471 (July 20, 2026)
- **PII protection for prompts sent to the LLM (Enterprise)** — a new Settings → PII Protection page lets admins redact personal data before it ever reaches a model. Prebuilt detectors (email, credit card, US SSN, phone, IPv4, IBAN, AWS key) ship out of the box, each holding multiple regex patterns under one switch; admins can add custom rules, edit replacement tokens, and set each rule to **Replace** (swap with a token) or **Block** (refuse the request). Redaction runs at the single LLM chokepoint, so it covers the whole assembled prompt — the user's message, instructions, schema samples, data previews and uploaded file text — across every agent. A live "test your rules" box previews redaction on sample text. Enterprise-gated: the feature is hidden and inert on community builds.
- **PII masked in the rendered UI, not just the model** — when protection is on, matched values are also redacted in what the app shows: the chat message/prompt and the table/widget cells render `[REDACTED_…]`, while the **stored** data stays real so analysis, step reuse and exports keep working on the true values. Masking happens only at the serialization boundary, so every surface (chat, inline previews, full tables, queries, report summary) is covered.
- **Fix Postgres CI: per-user connection credentials no longer reject timezone-aware timestamps** — `user_connection_credentials.last_used_at` / `expires_at` are naive columns; a timezone-aware datetime was accepted by SQLite but rejected by asyncpg on Postgres ("can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"), failing the Power BI overlay repro tests. The model now normalizes any aware datetime to naive UTC, so every caller is safe regardless of Postgres or SQLite.

## Version 0.0.470 (July 19, 2026)
- **Report diagrams no longer fail to render over unquoted labels** — a `mermaid` flowchart whose node label contained punctuation (e.g. `E[revenue SUM(Invoice.Total)]`) aborted the whole parse and showed the "DIAGRAM FAILED TO RENDER" source box. Doc diagrams now auto-repair on a render failure: unquoted flowchart node labels are quoted and the diagram is retried once before falling back to source, so existing reports render without re-generation. The planner is also instructed to quote such labels going forward. Edge labels and non-flowchart diagrams are left untouched, and the repair is display-only (the stored source is unchanged).
- **Instructions render Mermaid diagrams** — a ```mermaid block written in an instruction previously showed as a raw code block. It now renders as a diagram in the instruction view (everywhere `InstructionText` displays markdown — knowledge explorer, report side panels, agent flyouts), reusing the same renderer as reports so the unquoted-label auto-repair applies there too. Other fenced code (```sql, ```python, …) still shows as code.

## Version 0.0.469 (July 18, 2026)
- **Saving an LLM provider no longer 500s** — adding or updating a provider in Settings → LLM failed with a server error whenever the organization already had more than one model flagged as the default (or small default): the existence check used a query that raised on multiple rows. It now tolerates duplicates, and the same guard was applied to the default-model lookup on the completion path.
- **Context-window inputs accept real token counts** — the per-model context-window field snapped to 1,000-token steps, so the catalog's own defaults (1,000,000, 200,000, 1,047,576, …) were flagged "not a valid value." The field now accepts any whole number.

## Version 0.0.468 (July 18, 2026)
- **OneDrive, SharePoint & Outlook Mail connectors fixed end to end (#710)** — "Test credentials" for the Microsoft Graph file connectors no longer fails with a spurious "No access_token…" (the pre-save test was dropping the credentials for these clients); Outlook Mail's "Sign in with Microsoft" works (its per-user OAuth was unsupported and missing the `Mail.Read` scope); and a file tool addressed by a source's **name** instead of its internal id now resolves to that connection instead of the agent reporting the source as "disconnected" — a wrong identifier reads as an invalid selection, and reconnecting is only suggested after an actual token check.
- **Mail-native agent tools for Outlook (#710)** — a mailbox now exposes `list_emails` / `read_email` / `search_email` instead of the file tools, so the planner stops treating a mailbox as "files" and reliably opens a message after searching. Drive/SharePoint agents keep the file tools; a mixed agent gets both, each scoped to its own connection.
- **Provider icons and tidier tool rows (#710)** — file, email and MCP tool-call rows in the conversation now show the source's brand icon (OneDrive, SharePoint, Gmail, Notion, …) via a shared resolver, and the "Parameters" block moved inside each file tool row's collapsible section, so a collapsed row is just its header line and expanding reveals the results and parameters together.

## Version 0.0.467 (July 18, 2026)
- **Session events in the conversation** — out-of-band actions taken on a report now leave a trace the agent can see and (for some) a subtle gray strip in the timeline. Thumbs up/down, uploading or removing a file, switching the model, changing the agent's data-source scope, and sharing the conversation or an artifact are recorded as lightweight events, interleaved chronologically. The agent reads them on its next turn — so it stops rebuilding a stale picture of the world (e.g. re-suggesting a rejected instruction, or not knowing why the last answer was thumbed down). Events never start an agent run; they're a passive ledger. Feedback and instruction rejections survive context compaction (aggregated into the rolling summary) while transient events fall away, and a burst of events can't push real conversation turns out of the agent's window.

## Version 0.0.466 (July 18, 2026)
- **Auto model router** — a new org setting (Settings → LLM, off by default) that routes each request to the cheapest capable model. When a user picks no model, the run starts on the small model and the agent escalates to a stronger one only when the task needs it, via a `route_model` tool whose choices are the models you give routing guidance to; the escalation propagates to code generation too. Explicit per-message picks and report-pinned models always bypass routing. In a 10-question analytics benchmark on the demo dataset (65 model calls, small=GPT-4o mini vs default=GPT-4o), the router handled every question on the small model at held quality (LLM-judge 4/5 across the board) for a measured **~95% lower LLM cost** ($0.09 vs $2.04); real-world savings scale with your traffic mix and how often escalation is actually needed.
- **Realized routing savings on the cost console** — completions made under the router are credited against the model that would otherwise have run, so the LLM Usage Cost card and `/monitoring/cost` show a "Saved by auto-routing" KPI (dollars saved, share of calls routed) over any date range.
- **Edit per-model pricing** — admins can set a model's input/output price per million tokens inline in Settings → LLM (Cost column). Corrects preset rates or prices a self-hosted model, and feeds both the cost console and the router savings math.

## Version 0.0.465 (July 18, 2026)
- **Per-user agent memory (#703)** — the agent can now remember durable facts about you across sessions (preferences, writing style, analyses you liked) via a new `update_user_memory` tool, injected into each conversation as `<user_memory>` and subordinate to org instructions. It's scoped per user and organization, bounded and always-injected, available in chat/deep only, and viewable/editable in the profile's "Instructions & Memory" tab.

## Version 0.0.464 (July 17, 2026)
- **Rolling context compaction for Agent v2 (#689)** — long conversations no longer hit the context ceiling: the agent compacts older turns into a rolling summary automatically when the window fills (and on demand), keeps answering past the watermark, and the report chat shows a subtle "compacted" divider where the fold happened. Compaction is visible live via a `context.compacted` SSE and the context-usage estimate refreshes immediately.
- **Queue and steer prompts during a run (#690)** — typing while the agent is working no longer means waiting: **Queue** holds the prompt (shown as removable chips under the thinking indicator) and runs it when the current completion finishes, while **Steer** injects it into the running completion at the next observation point — hard-interrupting in-flight planning — with a visible acknowledgment on the message once the agent picks it up. Queued prompts stay out of the model's conversation window until they actually run.
- **Multi-pick clarifying questions (#693)** — the clarify tool supports select-all-that-apply: the agent can ask one question with multiple selectable options, the answer card renders checkboxes with a single confirm, and the selections rehydrate correctly on page refresh.
- **Conversation cost and tokens in the trace view (#694)** — TraceModal's header now shows the conversation's total LLM tokens and cost, and each turn's summary strip shows per-turn planner tokens — with full token and cost breakdowns sourced from usage events when licensed.
- **Fix empty review for NEW instructions pending approval (#695)** — reviewing a newly suggested instruction no longer opens an empty diff: the review payload for instructions that never had a published version now carries the proposed content instead of nothing.
- **Anti-overfit guard for learned instructions (#696)** — `create_instruction`/`edit_instruction` pass through a generality gate that rejects one-off, prompt-parroting rules before they pollute the instruction base, backed by an objective bait/control overfitting benchmark with a deterministic DB-based scorer (provider errors count as failed trials, not behavioral outcomes).
- **Smarter instruction loading with an on-demand catalog (#697)** — intelligent instructions are matched by coverage-based scoring (light stemming, title/label/table-name boosts) instead of brittle exact-word overlap, zero-score instructions fill remaining capacity instead of silently vanishing, and over-capacity ones become a compact catalog the planner can pull from via a new `read_instruction` tool (scoped to the report's data sources and the user's table access); `search_instructions` gains a compact chat mode.
- **Collapsible table-search results in chat** — the "Searched …" table results in the conversation now collapse to a single line by default, with each found table shown in the header with its data source icon (deduped, "+N more" past six); clicking the line expands the detailed per-table list as before.

## Version 0.0.463 (July 17, 2026)
- **Guided agent creation in training mode** — asking for an agent without saying what it should cover now starts a short, friendly interview: the assistant inspects the connection, then asks with clickable choices (schema or name-prefix groups with table counts, tool verb groups for MCP connections, plus "Everything") before creating anything. `create_agent` enforces it: on a large catalog with no selection it returns a `needs_selection` menu instead of silently creating a near-empty agent; an explicit `use_defaults` input covers the "everything" choice.

## Version 0.0.462 (July 17, 2026)
- **Per-model context window override (#680)** — admins can set a model's real context-window size in Settings → LLM and it now survives catalog re-syncs. Deployments that serve a model with a smaller window (e.g. AWS Bedrock capped at 100k) no longer fail mid-analysis with "context length exceeded", and the context-usage meter reflects the true limit. Clearing the override restores the catalog default.
- **Eval runs finalize server-side (#681, #682)** — a background eval run now evaluates its assertions and leaves `in_progress` on its own, per case, instead of waiting for someone to open the run page to drive the evaluation; the aggregate is idempotent and records the authoritative pass/fail/error status even under concurrent finalizers.
- **Eval agent loop (#682)** — the chat-driven cycle create → run (background) → wake-up → read → edit → rerun → compare now closes end to end without blocking the agent: `run_eval` is background-by-default, a run-finished wake-up posts results back into the conversation, and new `get_eval_run` / `get_eval_runs` / `stop_eval_run` / `edit_eval` / `cancel_wait` / `search_evals` tools plus a run-comparison view (fixed/regressed flips) support the loop. Includes an org concurrency cap and identical-run dedupe.
- **Thinking indicator above the prompt box (#684)** — while a completion is submitting or in progress, the prompt box shows a spinner, a shimmering "Thinking" label, and a live elapsed-time counter that also resumes after a mid-run page refresh and fades out when the run finishes or is stopped.
- **Cleaner shared conversations on mobile (#685)** — user and assistant avatars are hidden below the md breakpoint on the shared `/c/[token]` page, dropping the content indent to reclaim horizontal space and matching the report chat page.
- **Training mode builds agents** — three training-only tools let one prompt go from connection to ready agent: `list_connections` shows the connections you hold create-agent access on, `get_connection` browses a connection's tables-by-schema, MCP tools, or file scope (glob filter + pagination) before any agent exists, and `create_agent` creates the agent on existing connections with inline `schemas`/`tables`/`tools` glob selection, attaches it to the training session, and reports any unmatched selector. No credentials pass through the model — connections stay admin-created.
- **Agent card in the training chat** — a created agent renders as a card with status, description, and Tables/Tools/Files tabs (active/enabled counts live from the agent), plus an Open-agent link for refining the selection on the agent page.

## Version 0.0.461 (July 16, 2026)
- **DOS-Hebrew and any-encoding filenames now work end to end** — the legacy filename recovery gains cp862 (DOS-Hebrew) and ISO-8859-8, picks the best-quality decode instead of the first that succeeds (so Western `café.pdf` shares can't be misread as Hebrew), and adds an encoding-agnostic fallback that resolves a listed file by display-name match even when the encoding is unknown — a listed file can always be read/grepped, worst case with imperfect glyphs. Unrecoverable names log their raw bytes so the right charset can be identified from server logs without host access.
- **Repeating an identical tool call no longer ends the run** — the first repeat now injects a corrective note and lets the agent continue with the result it already has; only a further identical repeat stops the turn (previously the second call ended the run immediately, cutting off recoverable plans mid-flight).

## Version 0.0.460 (July 15, 2026)
- **File listings reach the agent, not just the UI** — list_files and search_files results (names, paths, sizes, ids) are now visible to the model itself, ending the blind re-list loop where the agent called the same listing repeatedly and the run ended with a false "Task completed successfully" message; that circuit-breaker message now tells the model to use the result it already has instead of claiming success.
- **Hebrew/legacy filenames recover instead of becoming `?????`** — directories with names stored in a legacy codepage (cp1255/cp1252 — Windows shares, zips extracted without a codepage) now show their real names in listings and answers, and reading/grepping those files round-trips to the on-disk bytes. Previously every non-ASCII character degraded to `?` (and before 0.0.458, permanently crashed the report).

## Version 0.0.459 (July 15, 2026)
- **SAP HANA / SAP Datasphere connections** — connect to SAP HANA, HANA Cloud, or an SAP Datasphere space (Open SQL schema) with a database user and query it in plain SQL via SAP's official `hdbcli` driver. Schema discovery covers tables **and views** (Datasphere exposes data as "Expose for Consumption" views) with comments and primary keys, system schemas are filtered out by default, and optional schema scoping accepts a comma-separated list — for Datasphere, the space schema. TLS on port 443 is the default (HANA Cloud/Datasphere); on-premise systems can set a custom port and disable encryption. Includes a reproducible HANA Express environment under `tools/hana/` for local verification.
- **read_file and grep_files work on conversation attachments** — uploaded files (JSON, text, logs, PDFs, images) are now readable by the same read_file/grep_files tools that serve file connections: leave connection_id empty and pass the file's id from the conversation. Windowed reads, PDF `page_range`, and line-level grep all work over attachments, and the tools appear in the agent's catalog whenever the conversation has files — no file connector required.
- **The agent can look at images — including ones from earlier turns** — read_file on an attached image shows it to a vision-capable model, so "what's in the screenshot I sent earlier?" now works (previously only images attached to the current message were visible, once). Scanned/image-only PDF pages render to vision per requested `page_range` instead of always the first 8 pages.
- **Attachments are decidable before reading** — the agent's file index now includes a content taste for every type: a 500-char head for JSON/text/logs, dimensions for images, and "N of M pages previewed — use page_range" for long PDFs (previously these rendered as "unsupported"). Conversation history records which files arrived with which message and what was read or viewed (`pages 2-2 of 38`, "viewed by vision"), so later turns can resolve "that file from earlier" by id.

## Version 0.0.458 (July 14, 2026)
- **Fix agents re-reading files in a loop** — read_file results (whole-file text/JSON/CSV head, windowed reads, and PDF page reads) now deliver a bounded content excerpt to the model instead of a bare summary line, with an honest trailer naming the session file and how to page the rest; superseded reads compact to a length marker so long file sessions don't bloat context. Verified live: the agent pages forward with offset/length instead of re-issuing identical reads.
- **PDF page-range reads** — read_file gains `page_range` (e.g. '2' or '10-15') for PDFs on Files & Directories and S3 connections: extracts only the requested pages and reports `pages_total`, so large documents are pageable like large text files instead of all-or-nothing.
- **Fix permanent 500 on reports after reading certain PDFs** — PDFs with broken ToUnicode CMaps make pypdf emit lone UTF-16 surrogates, which persisted with the completion and crashed every later load of the report (`UnicodeEncodeError: surrogates not allowed`). Extracted document text is now sanitized at the source, tool payloads are sanitized before persistence, and previously poisoned rows are scrubbed at read time so affected reports load again.
- **SharePoint/OneDrive search results show clean paths** — file paths in search_files results are now root-relative (`Contracts/acme.pdf`) instead of the raw Graph parentReference (`/drives/b!…/root:/…`), matching listings; file rows in the report view also show the path inline, and read_file headers show the file name instead of a truncated opaque id.

## Version 0.0.457 (July 14, 2026)
- **Bedrock API key authentication (#657)** — the AWS Bedrock provider gains an API Key auth mode alongside IAM and Access Keys: paste a Bedrock API key (the credential the AWS console now generates by default) and connect — no IAM roles or access-key pairs required. The key is injected as a per-provider Bearer token (never a process-global env var, so multiple orgs' keys stay isolated), and the UI notes that short-term keys expire within 12 hours.

## Version 0.0.456 (July 13, 2026)
- **Line-level grep over file sources (#649)** — a new `grep_files` agent tool runs deterministic regex over raw file bytes on Files & Directories and Amazon S3 connections, returning matching lines with line numbers and before/after context plus a total match count, per-file/total match caps, skipped-file reasons (binary, too large, off-scope), and a resumable cursor — so the agent extracts error lines from large log corpora at the source instead of paging whole files through context. Any text file greps regardless of extension (`.log`, `.ndjson`, extensionless); `include_globs` scoping is enforced and off-scope reads are audited.
- **Tool parameters visible on expand (#649)** — `list_files`, `search_files`, `read_file`, and `grep_files` calls in the report view show the exact arguments the agent passed (pattern, scope, paging cursor) behind a collapsed "Parameters" toggle, and windowed `read_file` calls show a byte-range progress badge.
- **Fix truncated `read_file` results being served from cache (#649)** — a large file's first read cached its clipped render and every later read (even with a higher `max_chars`) got the same fraction of the file back, including the session file handed to downstream analysis; truncated renders are no longer cached and stale clipped entries are read live.

## Version 0.0.455 (July 13, 2026)
- **Fix Slack/Teams channel settings crashing when connected** — a bare `@` in the "Usage notes" locale strings broke vue-i18n message parsing, blanking the panel in every language; the `@` is now escaped so connected Slack/Teams panels render again.

## Version 0.0.454 (July 13, 2026)
- **Configurable Teams/WhatsApp session staleness (#646)** — how long Teams 1:1 and WhatsApp chats keep continuing in the same conversation report is set per org in hours from Settings → Channels (`teams_session_max_age_hours`, default 120; `whatsapp_session_max_age_hours`, default 24; range 1–720).

## Version 0.0.453 (July 13, 2026)
- **Infor OLAP XMLA connections** — connect to Infor d/EPM through the OLAP Service Manager or ION API Gateway, with database-worker routing, application credentials, and actionable XMLA faults.

## Version 0.0.452 (July 12, 2026)
- **Files knowledge category with enforced glob scope (#630)** — file connectors (`network_dir`, Amazon S3) become their own Files category instead of masquerading as tables: the agent reads only files matching the connection's `include_globs`, off-scope reads are denied and audited (a `file.access_denied` entry in Settings → Audit Logs), large files page cursor-by-cursor via windowed reads, and a new `index_mode` tier (`none` / `metadata` / `content`) selects live listing, a cached file list, or a keyword index.
- **Agent notes (#631)** — the agent keeps a per-report markdown scratchpad it writes and reads while answering — plans as `- [ ]` checklists, findings, and progress — surfaced read-only in the report and injected back into the planner each iteration; gated by the `enable_agent_notes` org setting.
- **Per-model vision toggle (#632)** — admins can manually turn a model's image (vision) support on or off, and the choice persists even for preset models whose flags otherwise re-sync from the catalog; the toggle controls what the app sends (not the model's real capability), gated on `manage_llm` with a `llm_model.vision_toggled` audit entry.
- **Per-user MCP tool policies with in-run approval (#633)** — every MCP / custom-API tool now carries an `allow` / `ask` / `deny` / `auto` policy resolved per user (personal preference → agent overlay → connection default, with admin `deny` absolute). `ask` pauses the report run with an approval card (Allow once / Always allow / Deny / Always deny — "always" is remembered for future runs), `deny` hides the tool from the agent entirely, and `auto` lets the org's small default model review each call and approve or decline it with a visible reason. Enabling/disabling tools and setting default policies stays admin-only; members see the tools read-only and control only their own preference. Also hardens tool re-discovery: an empty provider response no longer wipes existing tools (or the overlays and preferences attached to them).

## Version 0.0.451 (July 12, 2026)
- **Doc "Save as PDF" exports the full document** — the print stylesheet isolated the document with `position: fixed`, which clips output to a single viewport box and cut the PDF off after a couple of pages; it now uses `position: absolute` with a content-driven height so tall docs (and their charts) paginate across the whole export in both the viewer and the editor.
- **Tighter default doc typography** — document body text is now 13px with a tighter 1.65 line-height (down from 15px / 1.75), and headings are scaled down a notch to match (h1 28→24px, h2 20→18px, h3 17→16px, h4 15→14px), for a compact, document-scale feel in both the viewer and editor.

## Version 0.0.450 (July 12, 2026)
- **Jaeger connector (#624)** — query distributed traces over the Jaeger Query HTTP API; each backend exposes `services`, `operations`, `spans`, and `dependencies` tables, and span search filters by service, operation, tags, latency, and errors.

## Version 0.0.449 (July 12, 2026)
- **`load_step` reuse is now opt-in (#620)** — the coder/planner feature that reuses a prior step's results via `load_step` is gated behind a new org setting `enable_load_step` (default **off**). Only steps built within a recent window (a fixed 300s) are advertised as reusable; re-running saved code that references older steps is unaffected. `load_entity` (published catalog entities) is independent and unchanged.
- **`new`/`חדש` starts a fresh report on Teams and WhatsApp (#619)** — sending a message that is exactly `new` or `חדש` on Teams 1:1 or WhatsApp forces a brand-new conversation report instead of reusing the recent one, so users can explicitly start over mid-conversation.
- **Power BI connector: workspace scoping and reliable connection test (#617)** — a new optional `workspaces` filter scopes discovery/indexing to named workspaces; the connection test now probes multiple datasets and classifies failures by layer (an engine-level error on an empty model passes with a warning), and listing/query calls gain Retry-After-aware backoff on 429/5xx.
- **Dependency security fixes (#618)** — resolved Snyk-reported Critical/High/Medium vulnerabilities in frontend (esbuild, tar, dompurify, markdown-it, and other transitives) and backend (pillow, pypdf, httplib2, pydantic-settings, setuptools) dependencies; zero Critical/High findings remain.

## Version 0.0.448 (July 11, 2026)
- **Document creation (#613)** — the analyst can now write findings as markdown documents, a new artifact type alongside dashboards and slides. Docs carry live charts, mermaid diagrams, tables, and per-claim citations (built for root-cause analyses, deep-dive reports, and memos), render in the report panel and on shared links, export to Markdown/PDF, and are editable in place by the report owner — with full RTL (Hebrew/Arabic) support.

## Version 0.0.447 (July 11, 2026)
- **Reliable completion streaming (#612)** — SSE now survives page refreshes, network drops, and backgrounded mobile tabs: the client reconnects and resumes live (running tool cards and the stop button included) instead of degrading to polling or showing a false error.

## Version 0.0.446 (July 11, 2026)
- **OpenAI model presets** — add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna; keep GPT-5.5 available, make Terra the default model, and retire older GPT-5.4/5.2 presets.

## Version 0.0.445 (July 11, 2026)
- **MCP connectors** — cleaner connect experience: pre-filled provider auth, tool previews, and one-click public agents.
- **Custom agent icons** — pin an emoji or connection icon per agent.

## Version 0.0.444 (July 11, 2026)
- **Elasticsearch connector** — query logs and metrics across indices, patterns, and data streams via the DSL (plus SQL/ES|QL); the index mapping is the schema, and rolling daily indices collapse into a single `<name>-*` pattern table.
- **Splunk connector (enterprise)** — investigate events across indexes and sourcetypes with SPL; the `index::sourcetype` catalog is enumerated cheaply and fields are sampled for the highest-volume sourcetypes, with the rest discovered on demand.
- **Thin-table field discovery** — `describe_tables` now samples a schema-on-read table's fields on inspection (so the agent stops treating "0 columns" as empty) and matches pattern/namespaced names (`security` → `security-*`, `web` → `web::access_combined`).

## Version 0.0.443 (July 10, 2026)
- **Prometheus connector (#595)** — query metrics with PromQL over the Prometheus HTTP API; each metric becomes a table.
- **Concurrent multi-tool execution (#598)** — one planner decision can run its tool calls in parallel (e.g. `create_data` across several sources), controlled by the `ai_tool_concurrency` org setting (defaults to 4; set to 1 for serial).
- **Per-connection request rate limit (#592)** — enterprise admins can cap requests per minute/hour/day on a connection, enforced as a hard block with audit logging.
- **Model-authored tool-call titles (#593)** — connection/external tool calls show a short human-readable label (e.g. "Searching Notion for churned customers") that streams live.
- **WhatsApp outbound images (#590)** — charts and image files are now sent to WhatsApp as native images with captions.
- **RTL email auto-detection (#597)** — free-form emails with Hebrew/Arabic content are automatically rendered right-to-left.
- **LLM selector shows the model's provider icon (#596)** — the prompt-box model button reflects the selected model's provider instead of a generic icon.
- **Zabbix connector (enterprise) (#591)** — query hosts, metrics, triggers, active problems, events, and metric history via the JSON-RPC API.
- **Fix iOS focus-zoom on the report prompt box (#600)** — the mobile prompt field is pinned to 16px so tapping it no longer zooms the viewport.

## Version 0.0.442 (July 9, 2026)
- **Fix SSO login for invited users with mismatched email casing** — invite emails are now matched case-insensitively so members can sign in via Entra/OIDC regardless of the casing the identity provider returns, and the provider's actual error is surfaced on the sign-in page.

## Version 0.0.441 (July 8, 2026)
- **AI-suggestion evidence in the Knowledge Explorer (#573)** — AI-proposed instruction changes now carry a brief evidence line (why the change was suggested), shown in review hover cards and the instruction detail.
- **Fix blank instruction editor in dev (#575)** — dedupe `prosemirror-state` so the tiptap editor mounts instead of rendering an empty body; falls back to a raw-markdown textarea if initialization ever fails.
- **Fix profile Usage tab never updating (#576)** — usage counters now record without a hard cap configured, and the tab refreshes the session on open instead of showing stale zeros.
- **Sandbox-violation feedback loop for codegen (#577)** — `unsafe_python` violations consume a retry instead of ending the run, and the failed code + error are fed back into the next generation attempt so it can self-correct.

## Version 0.0.440 (July 8, 2026)
- **Oracle thick-mode support for legacy servers (#548)** — Oracle connections to servers or accounts that python-oracledb thin mode can't handle (pre-12.1 versions, 10G-only password verifiers producing DPY-3015, Native Network Encryption) failed at connect time. The Docker image now bundles Oracle Instant Client 19c (amd64/arm64) and the backend switches the driver to thick mode at startup whenever the libraries are present — thick is a superset of thin, so existing connections are unaffected; hosts without the libraries (dev, airgapped) keep thin mode. Set `ORACLE_THICK_MODE=0` to force thin mode.
- **Oracle TCPS (TLS) connections (#548)** — the Oracle connector gains a "Use TCPS (TLS)" toggle for listeners that only accept TLS-encrypted SQL*Net (plain-TCP clients get their connection reset), plus a "Verify SSL" option that can be disabled for internal-CA certificates (thin mode only — thick mode's TLS trust requires an Oracle wallet).

## Version 0.0.439 (July 7, 2026)
- **ServiceNow connector (beta) (#563)** — new `servicenow` data source: query ITSM data (incidents, changes, problems, requests, CMDB, users) through the REST Table API with encoded queries. Bulk schema discovery from `sys_db_object`/`sys_dictionary` resolves inherited fields (incident ⊂ task) and turns reference fields into foreign keys; curated default table set with `tables` override and a `discover_all` mode for custom `u_*`/`x_*` tables; human-readable display values by default; actionable error when the instance user lacks metadata read access (a failure ServiceNow reports as HTTP 200 + empty result). Also fixes connection creation ignoring a registry entry's explicit `client_path`.

## Version 0.0.438 (July 7, 2026)
- **Triggers (#562)** — user-owned webhooks that spawn agent sessions, plus report-per-run routing for scheduled tasks, under a new Automations page.
- **QVD indexing progress (#564)** — real per-file indexing progress with stop, file size, and duration.
- **WhatsApp fixes (#565)** — agent replies (text + data) are now delivered back to WhatsApp, and the account-verification page shows WhatsApp branding instead of Slack.

## Version 0.0.437 (July 7, 2026)
- **OpenSearch data source connector (#560)** — indices, aliases and data streams become queryable with the query DSL, aggregations, or SQL.

## Version 0.0.436 (July 6, 2026)
- **Excel (.xlsx) export for CreateData + Hebrew CSV fix (#559)** — the CreateData result download becomes a CSV / Excel dropdown, with `.xlsx` generated server-side via `GET /steps/{id}/export?format=xlsx`. Every CSV export path (server, email attachment, client-side) now emits a UTF-8 BOM so non-ASCII (e.g. Hebrew) headers and values render correctly in Excel instead of ANSI mojibake, and a Unicode widget title no longer crashes the download (RFC 6266 `filename*`).
- **Fix agent-name chips and unreachable suggestion popover in instruction review (#558)** — the instruction editor's agents chip now shows the real agent name instead of its raw UUID even for deactivated or hidden agents (and lets you remove them), and the pending-review Accept/Reject popover is a single JS-positioned floating card anchored under the pointer — fixing it rendering far from the change and vanishing en route in RTL.

## Version 0.0.435 (July 6, 2026)
- **X (Twitter) MCP connector (#553)** — X's first-party MCP server (`https://api.x.com/mcp`) added to the connector catalog as a one-click tile with bearer-token (app-only) auth.
- **`wait` tool for Agent V2 (#554)** — the agent can pause the current turn and auto-resume after a one-shot delay (data refresh still running, rate limit, "try again in 30 minutes"), with a live countdown pill and cancel; not a scheduled task (ephemeral, sub-hour, self-deleting).
- **Scope agent-prompt visibility to membership (#555)** — prompt read visibility now mirrors the /agents list: admins see agent-scoped prompts only for agents they explicitly belong to (owner always sees their own); write/manage authority is unchanged.
- **Fix report rerun for artifact dashboards (#556)** — `POST /reports/{id}/rerun` now re-executes the artifact's query default steps (previously a silent no-op for artifact reports), the refresh reports its true outcome, and the retention purge skips reports shared in any mode so dashboards no longer go blank.


## Version 0.0.434 (July 5, 2026)
- **`network_dir` file connector (#519)** — new data source pointing at a directory (local folder or mounted SMB/NFS share) with `list_files` / `search_files` / `read_file` plus the first *write* capability for file sources (`write_file` agent tool). Path traversal and writes to read-only connections fail closed at a single chokepoint. No migration.
- **Seat cap enforced on all auto-provisioning paths (#540)** — the license `max_users` cap now applies to domain-signup invites, chat auto-provision, LDAP group sync, SCIM provisioning, and OIDC group sync (previously only admin invite / CSV import). New `app/core/seats.py` is the single source of truth; existing members are never blocked — only creation beyond the cap is refused.
- **Reliably responsive `create_artifact` dashboards (#545)** — the page/dashboard code-generation prompt now carries a concrete required responsive-layout section (fluid container, mobile-first grids, wrap/overflow rules), so generated dashboards reflow from the ~360px chat side-panel to full-screen.
- **Structured report schedule builder (#549)** — the report-refresh Schedule modal replaces the fixed dropdown with the structured recurring builder (every N minutes/hours, time of day, weekday chips, day of month), sharing one composable with the schedule-task modal.
- **Honor org row limit on refresh (#550)** — `limit_row_count` now applies to all data re-generation paths (report rerun, query run/preview, entity refresh/preview), not just initial creation; setting the limit to 0 correctly means "no limit" instead of returning 0 rows.


## Version 0.0.433 (July 4, 2026)
- **Claude Fable 5 support** — Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) is now a selectable Anthropic preset model.
- **Mobile web UI pass (#534)** — responsive fixes across the main mobile screens. The public artifact top bar is now icon-only on mobile (no more overlapping Back/tabs/Refreshed/Edit/✕), and the artifact/report browser tab (and "Add to Home screen" shortcut) shows the report title instead of the report UUID. Inputs are forced to 16px on small screens to stop iOS focus-zoom, full-height shells use `h-dvh`, and a mobile navigation drawer (hamburger + slide-in sidebar) makes Home/Reports/Dashboards/Settings reachable on a phone. The "Configure your LLM" banner is desktop-only, the report chat prompt box is full-width and aligned with the message/tool content, and the CreateData tool's children are mobile-friendly (data-table columns fill the width with no stray pagination footer; chart x-axis labels no longer overlap). Desktop layout is unchanged.
- **Fix /agents connections footer overflow** — the connections pane's "View all" footer no longer spills outside the pane.
- **MCP tool rows show the connector's icon** — `execute_mcp` rows in the report chat now render the catalog connector's brand icon (Monday, Jira, …) or the MCP logo for custom servers, instead of a generic glyph.


## Version 0.0.432 (July 3, 2026)
- Fix role-management RBAC ↔ legacy-role divergence and sso_only login lockout; adds backfill migration `rbacbf01` (#529)
- Fix extreme slowness on report/artifact pages with large data (#531)
- Fix missing numbers & empty charts in emailed/exported dashboard PDFs (#527)
- Fix pending-changes badge counting rows the pending view can't show (#528)
- Training-mode-for-agent-admins verification plan (#530)


## Version 0.0.431 (July 3, 2026)
- CSV data source connector (#522)
- Claude Sonnet 5 / Opus 4.8 support (#523)
- Enforce prompt write policy at the route layer (#524)
- Localized, direction-aware follow-up suggestions (#521)
- Fix single-value cards rendering the wrong cell as the metric (#520)


## Version 0.0.430 (July 2, 2026)
- Faster instruction loading
- Instructions view in reportagent vs knowledge view
- Prompt to support week day start


## Version 0.0.429 (July 2, 2026)
- **Faster page navigation (#513)** — batched whoami's per-org RBAC resolution, fixed the monitoring/reports N+1s, added hot-path indexes, and share one DB connection per request; pages load noticeably faster and no longer stall under load.

## Version 0.0.428 (June 29, 2026)
- **File references + MCP file materialization (#497)** — adds a `file_reference` model/route/service and materializes files surfaced by connector tools (MCP resources, Graph mail attachments) so they can be referenced as first-class files. Wires file materialization into `execute_mcp` / `read_mcp_resource` / the MCP client and adds a Graph mail client path. Backed by two migrations (`filesrc01` adds a file source-kind, `fileref01` adds the file-references table), chaining off the service-accounts head. Adds unit tests for the reference service and MCP file materialization.
- **/agents tree — lazy-load instructions + server-side search (#494)** — the Agents tree no longer loads **all** instructions on mount (`GET /instructions?limit=200`) and derives everything client-side. It now draws from cheap aggregate **counts** and loads rows **lazily on expand**. New backend endpoints: `GET /instructions/counts` (badge aggregates with no row hydration, same visibility filter as the list), `GET /knowledge/search?q=` (cross-entity grouped search over agents + instructions), and an `?global_only=true` list filter. The frontend mounts with counts + agents only, lazy-loads rows per group/agent on expand (with per-node spinners), turns "search everything" into a grouped server-side results view, and keeps a deduped lazy row cache. Validated with `tests/e2e/test_instruction.py` (17 passed).
- **Prompts tools in Training mode (#495)** — the training-mode agent can now curate reusable **Prompts** the same way it curates Instructions, via three new agent tools (`create_prompt`, `edit_prompt`, `search_prompts`, all `allowed_modes=["training"]`) surfaced as rich, localized tool cards. Unlike instructions, prompts go **live immediately** (no draft/approval build) by writing the `Prompt` row directly via `PromptService`, and authoring is governed by the agent-manager (`manage`) tier from #489 — `create`/`update` already require `manage` on each target agent (or org admin for `scope="global"`), so the tools inherit that gate with no new permission. New tool-card components mirror the instruction cards (scope/starter/param badges, `{{param}}` chips, Live state, "Open in Prompts"); localized across all 10 locales.
- **Service accounts for API use (#493)** — adds **service accounts**: non-human, org-managed API principals for automation/integrations, with their own RBAC role and API keys, owned at the org level (survive offboarding) and not tied to a person. A core (non-EE) capability gated by a new `manage_service_accounts` permission (covered by `full_admin_access`). Implemented as a `ServiceAccount` row backed by a hidden `users` row (`is_service_account=True`, `is_active=False`), so existing `users.id` FKs / ownership / RBAC work with no attribution migration; org binding lives on a dedicated `service_accounts` table so an SA consumes no license seat and never leaks into member lists. Login (JWT/SSO) is blocked while API keys keep working; a `forbid_service_account_principal` guard prevents a leaked SA key from minting keys, creating accounts, or assigning roles, and role assignment is capped to the creator's own permissions. New Service Accounts sub-tab under Settings → Members. Alembic migration `c2d3e4f5a6b7`.
- **Agent-manager RBAC tier (#489)** — a per-agent `manage` grant is now the "agent-manager" tier: a non-admin who owns or is granted `manage` on an agent can fully manage **that** agent — its tables, instructions, entities, evals and members — while staying scoped to their own agents. `manage` now implies `manage_instructions` / `create_entities` / `manage_evals` / `manage_members` (+ `view`/`view_schema`) on the **same** data source (not org-wide), the three table-mutation endpoints move from the read-tier `view_schema` to `manage`, and global instruction/entity creation stays gated on org-level `manage_instructions` / `create_entities`. Mirrored in the frontend (`usePermissions`, table/tools editing UI, and an agent settings panel that highlights the current user's effective role). Also adds **per-connection RBAC grants** (`manage_connection` / create / manage-agents) so a connection owner or grantee can manage that connection's config and build agents on it — surfaced in the role editor and the create-agent connection dropdown, with backend resolver support and e2e coverage.
- **Agent admins publish their own agents' instructions live + pending changes visible in the tree (#489/#494 follow-up)** — instruction publish was gated only on org-level `manage_instructions`, so an agent admin's create/edit on their own agent was staged as a pending non-admin proposal and never reached the main build, leaving it invisible in the lazy `/agents` tree (and spamming admins with review notifications). The auto-publish decision is now data-source-scoped: an agent admin (per-agent `manage`) auto-approves + promotes builds scoped entirely to their own agents (org admins still publish anything; authoring an org-wide global instruction stays an org-level capability). Separately, the tree's lazy list and counts now surface instructions that are still awaiting approval (e.g. AI/training suggestions) — rendered with an amber "Pending review" dot + chip and a "not live yet, waiting for approval" tooltip — instead of hiding them. The agent's runtime instruction set is unaffected (it reads the main build directly).
- **External MCP tool gateway (#487)** — BoW's external MCP server (`/api/mcp`) can now act as a gateway in front of each agent's connected **MCP servers** and **custom APIs**, letting an external MCP client discover and trigger those tools through BoW alongside the existing `create_data` / `inspect_data` surface. New `ConnectionToolGateway` service resolves an agent's tools and computes effective enable/policy from the per-agent overlay (allow-only over the gateway); new `list_agent_tools` (discovery with full input schemas) and `execute_mcp` (invocation) MCP tools; `get_context` now advertises each agent's tools plus a `tools_hint`.
- **Gate low-confidence notifications (#486)** — the `low_confidence` review producer fired on every answer scored below 3/5, which felt like it triggered on nearly all prompts. A `low_confidence` notification is now only surfaced once an agent accumulates **5 answers scored below 3/5 within a rolling 7-day window**; below the floor the low score is tracked silently via the completions ledger. Per-agent dedup and dismissal/resurface behavior are unchanged.
- **Release DB connection before serialization on hot reads (#485)** — every authenticated request held one pooled DB connection for its entire lifetime (across response serialization too), so a burst on the `/agents` page could exhaust the pool and stall every endpoint at a uniform ~10s. Adds `release_request_db(db)` and calls it at the end of the hot read handlers (`/reports`, `/instructions`, `/instructions/pending-changes`, `/data_sources/active`, `/data_sources/{id}/full_schema`) so the connection returns to the pool before serialization — mirroring the proven SSE early-release pattern.
- **Connectors without agents (#467)** — tool providers (e.g. Notion) are now usable standalone without wrapping them in a full analytical agent, including Notion dynamic client registration (DCR) OAuth and connector-aware UI in the Knowledge Explorer (`connector_key`, `is_connector`, a "Connector" badge). Localized across all 10 locales.
- **Quota policies — monthly spend cap in USD (#488)** — usage policies can now cap monthly LLM **dollar spend** (`monthly_spend_limit_usd`) in addition to tokens, queries, and data volume. Spend is tracked in micro-USD on a new `llm_cost_micro_usd` usage counter, computed per LLM call from the same per-model token rates the Cost console uses, and buffered on the per-agent `UsageLimitContext` then flushed at end-of-run (mirroring the token path). The pre-call quota check now also stops a user once their buffered+recorded spend reaches the cap (a 429 with metric `llm_cost_micro_usd`). The Create/Edit Quota modal gains a **Monthly spend limit (USD)** field and a per-policy **Spend** badge; the whoami usage-quota summary exposes a `spend` metric in USD. Localized (en/he/es).
- **Localize the monitoring Cost tab + RTL (#492)** — the `/monitoring` Cost tab used `monitoring.cost.*` keys that existed only in `en.json`, so every other locale silently fell back to English. Adds the full `monitoring.cost` block (33 keys) plus the `tabCost` label to all 9 non-English locales, localizes the echarts trend tooltip/series name, and makes the metric toggle RTL-ready (physical `border-l` → logical `border-s`, `space-x-2` → `gap-2`).
- **Fix — `[object Object]` in Custom API headers/endpoints (#491)** — in the Custom API "Edit connection" form, the **Custom Headers** (`dict`) and **Endpoints** (`list`, `ui:type: "json"`) fields fell through to a plain-text input bound to an object/array and rendered as `[object Object]`. Tags `headers` with `ui:type: "keyvalue"` to use the key/value row editor, and adds a `json` field type to `ConnectForm.vue` (monospace textarea with parse/serialize sync, inline "Invalid JSON" error, and a proper array/object default).

## Version 0.0.427 (June 28, 2026)
- **Reports sidebar sorts by last activity (#479)** — the report list (sidebar and `/reports`) now orders by real conversation activity (`is_starred DESC, last_activity_at DESC`) instead of creation date, so an active chat moves to the top. Backed by a new denormalized, indexed `reports.last_activity_at` column bumped at two coarse choke points (new user message, agent turn finalize) and backfilled from `MAX(completions.created_at)`, keeping the list read cheap (no join to the high-volume completions table). The sidebar "REPORTS" header now links to `/reports`.
- **Run scheduled prompts on demand (#474)** — a new **Run now** button in the scheduled-prompt modal triggers a scheduled prompt immediately without waiting for its cron, via a new `…/scheduled-prompts/{id}/trigger` endpoint. Manual runs use `force=True` to bypass the cross-worker claim and the `is_active` pause check, are restricted to the prompt owner (404 for missing, 403 for unauthorized), persist any unsaved edits first, and navigate to the report to watch execution. Localized across all 10 locales.
- **Global Evals in the /agents tree (#478)** — a new **Global Evals** entry below **Skills** in the Knowledge Explorer surfaces org-wide test cases (those scoped to all agents) in one place rather than only inside each agent's Evals panel. Admin-gated by `manage_evals`, with per-agent-only controls (reliability badge, Self Learning, "Run evals now") hidden in global mode. Client-side filter only — no backend changes.
- **Audit coverage for prompts, RBAC, webhooks, OAuth & more (#466)** — closes the high-priority gap where ~75 state-changing endpoints emitted no audit trail. Adds best-effort, route-level `audit_service.log(...)` calls (capturing IP / user-agent, wrapped so an audit failure never breaks the request) for prompts, scheduled prompts, RBAC (roles, groups, memberships, role assignments, resource grants), webhooks, OAuth clients, usage policies, and external user mappings. Action types are discovered dynamically by the audit UI, so no registry change is needed. Adds `docs/design/audit-trail-coverage.md` documenting the full inventory and deferred follow-ups.
- **Fix — report title sometimes never set on Postgres (#475)** — the auto-generated report title was written by a fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task` that got garbage-collected before its LLM call returned (worst on Postgres, where the pooled connection recycles the instant the response completes), leaving reports stuck on `untitled report`. Title generation now runs inline so the DB session stays alive, and is gated on the title value (empty/placeholder) rather than "first completion" — making it self-healing across turns. The sidebar also live-updates the title in place (with a fade-in) via a `report:updated` event instead of waiting for the next navigation.
- **Fix — notification inbox order + never blank on a bad row (#477)** — the inbox could show a non-zero unread badge over an empty "all caught up" panel when the list endpoint 500'd on a single malformed row, and (when items showed) sorted severity-first so stale high-severity rows outranked fresh ones. The list now sorts newest-first (severity only as a tiebreaker), swallows unrepresentable timestamps, falls back to DB ordering on any sort error, and serializes each row independently so one poison row degrades to a placeholder instead of blanking the list. The frontend now shows a "Couldn't load / Try again" state instead of masquerading a failed fetch as an empty inbox.
- **Fix — slow /agents instructions load (#476)** — the Instructions tree-pane could take a minute+ on large orgs because `get_pending_change_instruction_ids` ran an N+1 (`review_hunks()` once per pending instruction org-wide, ~8 SQL statements each). Replaced with a fixed set of bulk queries plus an in-memory diff pass — byte-for-byte identical results with the same per-hunk rules. Measured on a 600-instruction seed: 4801 → **4** SQL statements and 5.41s → **0.28s** service time.
- **Fix — TraceModal outer scrollbar clipped summary badges (#473)** — incomplete cancellation of the UCard body padding pushed the trace modal past its fixed height, adding an outer scrollbar that overlaid the summary strip and clipped the right-aligned LLM-judge score badge (`Resp x/5`). Removes the card body padding (matching `BuildExplorerModal`) so the modal no longer overflows. Template-only.
- **OpenShift (OCP) deployment fixes (#468)** — removes the redundant file-based log handler (`RotatingFileHandler` → `logs/app.log`), which broke under OCP's read-only root filesystem; logs now go to stdout/stderr only (12-factor). Also disables asyncpg SSL auto-detection for unconfigured connections (`ssl_mode` unset → `ssl=False`), preventing the `~/.postgresql/` client-cert lookup that failed with "Permission denied" under OCP's arbitrary-UID pods. No breaking change: `ssl_mode: require` / `verify-full` behave as before.

## Version 0.0.426 (June 27, 2026)
- Add **Prompts** - save and reuse prompts. Including running for usrers
- Added **Notifications** - sharing/alerts from agents will be shown here
- Redesigned main nav menu to include inline reports, prompts, and clean ups

## Version 0.0.425 (June 25, 2026)
- **Channels (integrations) settings — full localization + RTL fixes (#452)** — the six **Settings → Channels** panels (Slack, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, AI Mailbox, Excel Add-in, OAuth Clients) were hardcoded in English; every user-facing string is now wired through i18n with a new `settings.integrations.channels.*` key set translated into all 10 locales (code literals like `users:read.email`, `manifest.xml`, and `X-Hub-Signature-256` kept literal via slots). Also fills previously-untranslated integration keys that silently fell back to English, and fixes RTL in `OAuthClientsModal` (physical `ml-`/`mr-`/`right-` → logical `ms-`/`me-`/`end-`), keeping list rows icon-left / status-right under RTL.
- **Personal API keys in the User Profile + MCP modal fix (#451)** — the user profile modal gains an **API Keys** tab (list, one-time-reveal generate, delete) for the `bow_…` tokens used by the MCP server / programmatic access, reusing the per-user `/api/api_keys` endpoints. Also fixes a bug where the MCP modal always showed **"0 API tokens"** when opened from the sidebar: its key-list `watch` wasn't `{ immediate: true }`, so on the already-open (`v-if`) mount the loader never ran. New `profile.apiKeys.*` strings across all 10 locales.
- **Per-model LLM access control (RBAC, enterprise) (#449)** — admins can restrict individual LLM models to specific users, groups, or roles. Models are **open by default**; restriction is opt-in per model (`is_restricted`) and reuses the existing `ResourceGrant` permission machinery. When a model is restricted, only principals with an explicit grant can see and use it; **full admins bypass** restrictions and **members without a grant get 403**. An **always-available guard** prevents restricting the org default / small-default models (400) so an org can't lock itself out, and enforcement is **fail-open** when the `llm_access_control` license feature is inactive (no regression for non-EE installs). Enforced in both `get_models` (list/picker) and `get_model_by_id` (the real completion-selection boundary), with audited `…/models/{id}/access` and `…/models/{id}/restricted` routes. Surfaced as a new **Access** column + grant modal in the models settings table and in the role editor.
- **Apache Druid — API token (bearer) authentication** — the Druid connector now offers an **API Token** auth method alongside Username / Password, for endpoints that authenticate with a bearer token (e.g. Imply Polaris API tokens). The token is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` via the driver's `jwt` path and is mutually exclusive with Basic auth (a token suppresses any user/password). Pick it from the connection's auth-method selector; the token is encrypted at rest like any other credential.

## Version 0.0.424 (June 25, 2026)
- **Fix — single-value cards show the asked-for value over melted KPI tables (#446)** — when `create_data` produces a melted/long KPI result (`Metric | Value | Format`, one row per metric), a single-value `count` / `metric_card` no longer renders the wrong row (the date, or the sum of every metric). The row-selecting default filter is now carried through `create_data` and `agent_v2` (previously dropped), derived deterministically when the viz model omits it (`derive_kpi_row_filter`), and applied in `ToolWidgetPreview` via the view's own `defaultFilters`.
- **Monitoring — surface origin platform in diagnosis/trace (#447)** — the monitoring diagnosis table and trace modal now show where each agent run originated (Slack / Teams / WhatsApp / MCP / Email vs. the web UI). An origin platform icon sits next to each run's message and an origin badge in the trace header (web-UI runs show none); `external_platform` is plumbed through `AgentExecutionSummaryItem`, `ConversationTraceResponse`, and `console_service`. The diagnosis **User** column moved next to the prompt, and **Date** now shows date and time in the org timezone.

## Version 0.0.423 (June 25, 2026)
- **Cost console — LLM spend by user / agent / group over time (#440)** — a new **Cost** tab under `/monitoring` for admins, breaking LLM token and dollar spend down by user, agent (data source), group, model, provider, or feature (scope) over a date range, with KPI totals, a daily cost/tokens trend chart, and a per-dimension breakdown table. Backed by new attribution columns (`organization_id` / `user_id` / `report_id` / `data_source_id`) on `llm_usage_records` — all nullable, so pre-existing rows stay org-scoped and the rest surface as an **"Unattributed"** bucket. Attribution is stamped once per agent run via an ambient context var and snapshotted at record-schedule time, so it survives the background recorder and the worker-thread judge (tool sub-calls included).
- **Follow-up question suggestions (#441)** — after each answer in the web app, the agent proposes a few natural next questions, rendered as minimalist chips below the feedback bar. Gated to web sessions only (Slack/Teams/Email/Excel/scheduled runs are excluded) and to the org setting **`enable_follow_ups`** (on by default, surfaced in AI settings). Suggestions are generated inline at the tail of the agent run on the small/default model, persisted on the completion (`follow_ups` column) and pushed over SSE for instant render, and rehydrated on reload.
- **Report avatar branding + per-model provider logo (#442)** — the assistant avatar in a report now renders the **organization's uploaded brand image** (falling back to the BoW logo), height-bound and aspect-ratio-safe, with a small overlay badge for the **LLM brand** that produced each completion and a `Generated with …` tooltip. Brand resolution is name-first (`claude → anthropic`, `gpt/o1/o3 → openai`, `gemini → google`), falling back to the hosting provider type, so a Claude/GPT model served via Bedrock or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint still shows its true model brand. The shipped Anthropic provider icon is replaced with the orange **Claude** mark (square burst for compact slots, burst + wordmark for the provider picker).

## Version 0.0.422 (June 24, 2026)
- **Dark mode** — comprehensive dark theme across the app using Tailwind's `dark:` variant strategy driven by `@nuxtjs/color-mode` (default preference `system`, so the OS setting is respected on first load). Form inputs get explicit dark backgrounds, light PNG illustrations are hidden in favor of icon placeholders, and ECharts render with a dark theme. Choose Light / Dark / System per user from the new profile modal's **Appearance** tab.
- **User profile modal** — a new modal opened from the sidebar user menu (**Profile**), with four sections: **General** (avatar upload/remove, editable full name, email, and a summary of linked external platforms), **Custom Instructions** (a personal note about yourself surfaced to the AI when it works on your behalf — stored as your per-org membership note), **Usage** (per-user tokens/queries/data for the current window, with a clear notice when usage tracking isn't enabled), and **Appearance** (theme + language). Avatars are stored on the user (`users.image_url`, migration `usravatar01`) and now also render in the sidebar and on your messages in reports.
- **Per-user language override** — each user can pick their own interface language from **Appearance**, overriding the organization default for their account only (persisted per browser). The profile modal is fully localized across all supported languages.

## Version 0.0.421 (June 24, 2026)
- **Auto-reindex schedule — interval _or_ fixed time** — a connection's scheduled schema reindex (including QVD sources) can now run **either** on a recurring interval (every N minutes/hours, 10-minute minimum) **or** at a fixed daily time, chosen per connection in the connection detail panel. Fixed times are interpreted in the organization timezone. (Enterprise `scheduled_reindex`.)
- **Organization timezone** — a new **Settings → General** option that sets the org's IANA timezone. Timestamps across the app (reports, monitoring, audit, instructions, integrations, etc.) now render in it, scheduled jobs (reindex times and scheduled reports) fire in it, and the planner is told the current time in it. Storage stays UTC — the timezone only governs schedule interpretation and display; leaving it unset keeps the prior browser-local behavior.

## Version 0.0.420 (June 23, 2026)
- **Fix — BigQuery queries failed with "Please install the 'db-dtypes' package"** — added the `db-dtypes` runtime dependency so BigQuery results convert to dataframes correctly.

## Version 0.0.419 (June 23, 2026)
- **Instructions — scope by run-mode and delivery channel** — instructions can now be restricted to specific agent run-modes (Chat, Deep analytics, Training) and delivery channels (Web app, Slack, Teams, AI mailbox, MCP). The selectors live in a new collapsible **Advanced** section of the instruction editor (empty = applies everywhere). The scoping is honored at prompt-build time so an instruction only loads in the modes/channels it targets, and the fields are versioned (snapshotted into instruction versions and carried through build promotion/diffing).
- **Fix — instruction "Pending review" status was inconsistent across views** — the same instruction could read **Active** in the agent instruction view but **Pending review** in the report agent panel. The list and single-instruction endpoints now derive the pending signal from the same authoritative per-hunk review rule as `/instructions/pending-changes`, so a leftover/already-applied (covered) build no longer over-reports as pending. The status dropdown in the report agent editor also stops showing a value ("Pending review") that wasn't one of its options.
- **Fix — "+" to add an instruction was hidden behind the Review panel** — clicking the **+** on Instructions while the Review feed was open now closes Review and opens the new-instruction editor instead of doing nothing.

## Version 0.0.418 (June 23, 2026)
- **Microsoft Analysis Services (SSAS) data source** — a new enterprise connector for SQL Server Analysis Services over XMLA, supporting both Multidimensional (MDX) and Tabular (DAX/MDX) models.

## Version 0.0.417 (June 21, 2026)
- **Infor OLAP (Infor d/EPM) data source (#425)** — a new enterprise connector for the Infor d/EPM OLAP semantic layer (formerly Infor BI / MIS Alea OLAP), the supported path into on-premise **Infor OLAP 25.x** where native connections are gone and **XMLA is mandatory**. It speaks the standard **XMLA SOAP** contract over HTTP with Basic auth: schema discovery via `Discover` (catalogs, cubes, dimension hierarchies, and measures — each cube surfaced as a `Catalog/Cube` table whose columns carry their MDX `unique_name`), and query execution via `Execute` (Tabular) that runs **MDX** and flattens the rowset into a DataFrame (decoding XMLA `_xHHHH_` escapes). SOAP faults and inline XMLA errors surface as clear errors. Configurable endpoint URL, optional catalog scope, SSL verification, and timeout.
- **Agents — connections footer fixes** — the bottom-left **Connections** footer is no longer pushed off-screen (requiring a scroll) when a top banner is shown: the Knowledge Explorer now sizes itself to the viewport minus the banner height. It also shows an explicit **"Add connection"** CTA in the empty state, and **childless connections** — created but not yet linked to any agent — now appear in the list instead of being hidden until an agent exists.
- **Fix — Tables selector "Save" button hidden until scroll** — the Save bar in the tables selector is now pinned (sticky) to the bottom of its scroll container, so it stays visible without scrolling to the end of long table lists (agent Tables panel, schema wizard, onboarding, etc.).
- **Fix — report tool card flicker** — the `edit_instruction` tool card no longer rapidly flickers between its rendered document and its `v1 → v2` version-diff view during/after an edit stream. The card is keyed on the stable block id so streaming/poll updates no longer remount it.
- **Fix — Microsoft Fabric "Login timeout expired" on cold-start endpoints** — Fabric Warehouse/Lakehouse SQL endpoints are serverless and can be slow to respond on the first connection after the capacity has been idle, routinely exceeding the ODBC driver's short default login timeout (~15s) and surfacing as `HYT00 … Login timeout expired (SQLDriverConnect)`. The Fabric client now sets a generous 60s login timeout (`Connect Timeout` + `pyodbc` `timeout`), adds driver-level `ConnectRetryCount`, and retries transient connection-timeout SQLSTATEs (`HYT00`/`HYT01`/`08001`/`08S01`) a few times with backoff so a cold endpoint gets a chance to wake up. This affects both service-principal and per-user (OBO/Entra) auth.

## Version 0.0.416 (June 21, 2026)
- **Backend dependency management moved from pip to uv (#408)** — `requirements_versioned.txt` is replaced by a PEP 621 `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, the Docker build and CI now use `uv sync --frozen`, and contributors install with `uv sync --extra dev` (see `DEV.md`). uv is from the same Astral toolchain as ruff and is significantly faster than pip/Poetry.
- **Security — resolved all High/Critical dependency vulnerabilities** flagged by Snyk in both the backend (uv) and frontend (yarn) dependency trees.
  - Backend: `cryptography` 46.0.7 → 49.0.0 (out-of-bounds read) and `starlette` 0.50.0 → 1.3.1 (SSRF, resource exhaustion, unsafe reflection, request smuggling, incorrectly-resolved name). Resolving Starlette required matching bumps to `fastapi` (→ 0.138.0), `fastapi-mail` (→ 1.6.5), and `aiosmtplib` (→ 5.1.2), which previously capped it. Backend scan now reports **0 issues**.
  - Frontend: `nuxt` → ^3.21.7 (open redirect), `vite` resolution corrected to `>=7.3.5 <8` (directory traversal — the prior resolution pinned the vulnerable 7.3.3), and a new `ws` resolution `>=8.21.0` (asymmetric resource consumption). Frontend now has **0 High/Critical** issues.
- **Docs** — added `docs/snyk-dependency-scanning.md` (skill-format guide) covering how to scan the uv backend and yarn frontend with the Snyk CLI and apply fixes.

## Version 0.0.415 (June 20, 2026)
- **Knowledge Explorer** — a new three-pane workspace (at `/instructions`) for browsing and managing everything an agent knows: global instructions, skills, per-agent resources, pending reviews, and each agent's tables and tools. Tree navigation with search and filtering (by status, load mode, source, category), inline editing of titles/descriptions/conversation starters, file upload and preview, and a version-history pane with diff view.
- **Agent management** — a guided **New Agent wizard**, a dedicated **Agent Settings** panel, and per-agent **automation settings**, plus a clearer public/private agent distinction surfaced across the UI.
- **Continual & self-learning** — agents can automatically run evals and a retrain/reliability loop (e.g. on instruction or table changes), surfaced in a new **Agent Evals** panel, so higher-autonomy agents keep improving on their own.
- **Skills with smart loading** — instructions can now be authored as **skills** that load on demand: the prompt carries a lightweight skills catalog and the agent reads a skill's full body only when it needs it (`read_skill`), keeping context lean.
- **Suggestions & review workflow** — a **pending-review feed** with **per-hunk tracked changes** (accept or reject individual edits), diff visualization, and an approval flow for instruction suggestions.
- **Better instruction management** — instruction **descriptions**, table-scoped instructions with name-based datasource fallback, and improved reference resolution (connection-table IDs, bare and schema-prefixed table names).

## Version 0.0.414 (June 18, 2026)
- **Fix — long instructions hid the Edit button in the instruction modal** — in the global create/edit instruction modal, a long instruction body made the content area un-scrollable and pushed the action footer (Edit in view mode; Update/Cancel in edit mode) off the bottom of the modal, so the instruction couldn't be edited. The modal now keeps a properly bounded flex layout so the content scrolls internally and the footer stays visible.

## Version 0.0.413 (June 18, 2026)
- feat(mcp): let the agent read MCP server resources (list_mcp_resources + read_mcp_resource)
- fix: prevent 'Cannot use import statement outside a module' in artifact iframe 

## Version 0.0.412 (June 16, 2026)
- **Apache Druid data source** — connect to Apache Druid and query it as a new data source.
- **Trino data source** — connect to the Trino distributed SQL engine and query it as a new data source.
- Agents page redesign - easier navigation around instructions, tools, tables, tc
- **Continual Learning** - trigger evals -> retrain loop on table change or instruction change for high autonomy

## Version 0.0.411 (June 15, 2026)
- **⌘K command palette** — a global **⌘K / Ctrl+K** palette for quick navigation and creation, opened from anywhere in the app. One input searches across **recent reports**, **agents**, and **instructions** (server-side search for reports/instructions, client-side filtering for agents; recents shown by default), with pinned, query-echoing create actions: `New report "…"` (creates and navigates) and a permission-aware `New instruction "…"` / `Suggest instruction "…"` that opens the instruction modal pre-filled with the typed text. No-match queries still surface the create actions.
- **Publishing lifecycle for agents (`publish_status`)** — a manager-set publishing state, distinct from the system-managed connection-health flag: **published** (visible to everyone with access), **draft** (visible only to builders who can `manage` the agent), and **disabled** (hidden everywhere and excluded from AI context). Viewer-aware filtering applies across the data-source/agent selector, schema context, and public (Slack) listing; consumers see only published agents while managers also see drafts. Existing agents are backfilled to *published*.
- **Agent research tools (`search_reports` / `read_report`)** — two read-only planner tools that let the agent discover and read **the current user's own reports**: `search_reports` lists/substring-searches the caller's reports by title with status/mode filters, and `read_report` returns one of the caller's reports (metadata, data sources, artifact summary, conversation). Both are strictly scoped to the caller — any other report, including ones merely shared with the user, returns *not found* (no leak) — and each has its own tool card in the report view.
- **Settings → Channels** — the settings **Integrations** tab is renamed **Channels** across all locales, with a redesigned page (and a new empty state). The **SMTP Server** configuration moves from a modal into its own dedicated settings page.
- **Test Connection for existing LLM providers** — the **Test Connection** button is now available when editing an existing LLM provider, not just when adding a new one. Blank credential fields fall back to the stored (encrypted) values, so you can re-test a saved provider without re-entering secrets.
- **Instruction modal redesign** — the create/edit instruction modal gains a wider split layout with a dedicated, slide-in **analysis panel** (related instructions, impacted prompts, and impact score) and a cleaner global-vs-private form structure.
- **Scheduled tasks** — clicking a scheduled task card now opens its edit modal directly (clicking the report name still navigates to the report), and the modal shows a link back to the report when editing a task tied to one.
- **Fix — second admin sees empty tables on shared OBO/Fabric agents** — on a shared-catalog `user_required` (Fabric/PowerBI/OBO) data source, a second admin with a valid delegated token saw zero tables and *Reload tables* didn't help, because the reload refreshed only the canonical catalog and never the caller's per-user overlay. The shared-catalog reload now also refreshes the caller's overlay so their tables appear immediately, without leaking the canonical catalog to disconnected callers.
- **Fix — race when deleting a data source during background indexing** — deleting a data source while a background connection indexer was re-syncing schema tables could reintroduce `datasource_tables` rows and trigger a foreign-key violation. The delete now re-clears the schema tables and retries until the indexer stops producing rows.
- **Fix — RTL alignment** in the Clarify tool.

## Version 0.0.410 (June 13, 2026)
- **Email the AI analyst (AI Mailbox)** — a new **Email** channel (alongside Slack/Teams/WhatsApp) lets people email the analyst and get answers back. It's IMAP/SMTP under the hood (provider-agnostic: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or any self-hosted server) with three auth modes — password/app-password, **Microsoft 365 app-only OAuth** (XOAUTH2), and **Google Workspace** (service account + domain-wide delegation). Inbound mail flows into a report, the agent replies in-thread (with a deep link back to the report), and **attachments are ingested as report files** (size-limited). Configure it from **Settings → Integrations**, with an inline **Test connection** before saving. IMAP is the optional upgrade that turns a send-only mailbox into a two-way channel.
- **Verify-first inbound identity** — by default a new sender must prove they control both the mailbox *and* a BOW account: first contact gets a **verification link** that, clicked while signed in, creates a trusted `email → user` binding (subsequent mail is trusted, like Slack/Teams). A spoofable `From` alone never grants data access. A pre-filter (DMARC/DKIM where available + domain allowlist + loop/auto-reply suppression) drops spoofers and noise first; registered-but-unlinked users, open invites, and signup-admitted domains each get the appropriate link rung, and everything else is **ignored + audited**. Auto-linking without verification is now an explicit, clearly-labeled opt-in.
- **Org SMTP transport** — a dedicated **SMTP Server** setting (separate from the AI Mailbox) becomes the org's transport for *system* mail — share notifications, scheduled-report/prompt results, verification links — overriding the global `bow-config` SMTP. The password is Fernet-encrypted at rest, no-auth/anonymous relays and a `validate_certs` toggle are supported, and there's a pre-save Test connection. Analyst mail always uses the mailbox; system mail never does — the two transports are kept strictly separate.
- **Scheduled schema auto-reindex** — connections can now periodically re-index themselves so tables stay fresh, with a per-connection toggle and a configurable interval (every N hours) in the connection detail modal; the last reindex error is surfaced inline. Scheduled reindexing is an enterprise feature.
- **Per-org license quotas** — licenses can now cap `max_users` and `max_agents` per organization (claims read from the license JWT; missing/negative means unlimited), enforced on user and agent creation.
- **Guaranteed data access on every dashboard** — building on 0.0.409's component ⓘ popover, an always-on, LLM-independent **DataInspector** (a floating "Data" button auto-mounted into the dashboard iframe) lists every visualization with the same **Data**/**Code** tabs, so even fully custom dashboards that never use the prebuilt cards still expose their backing data and query. A bare `<EChart>` outside a SectionCard now also carries the ⓘ popover. Suppressed in headless thumbnail/preview renders.
- **Instruction pill fix** — the report completion pill now includes **system-category** instructions (previously hidden), and partial/pill accepts are reflected correctly in the knowledge group.

## Version 0.0.409 (June 11, 2026)
- **Built-in info popover on dashboard components** — the prebuilt KPICard and SectionCard now carry a small ⓘ popover that surfaces a component's backing data. It opens on a **Data** tab (the actual visualization rows in a compact scrollable table) with a **Code** tab for the generating query, plus metadata above (source, type, row/column counts, active filters) and the viz id in a persistent footer. Both producers wire it automatically: deterministic "Add to Dashboard" codegen emits `viz={viz[N]}`, and the `create_artifact` / `edit_artifact` prompts instruct the model to do the same. The popover is **filter-aware** — when a component renders filtered rows it shows exactly what's on screen ("X of Y rows (filtered)") and only attributes filters that map onto the viz's columns, falling back to the full dataset otherwise.
- **Spark Connect data source** — new connector for querying Spark via the Spark Connect protocol, with partition metadata in the schema, a pre-flight `EXPLAIN` gate (partition-filter + scan-size guard), and a Spark icon in the data-source picker.
- **Scheduled tasks on specific days of the week** — recurring scheduled prompts can now target specific weekdays (e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri) instead of only daily/interval cadences, with localized day labels (including conventional Arabic/Hebrew day-of-week abbreviations).
- **Copy invite link always returns a usable link** — copying a pending member's link now rotates the token and resets the 14-day window if the invite has expired (or had no token), clearing the **Expired** badge; a still-valid link is returned unchanged so an already-emailed link isn't invalidated. No email is sent (that's **Resend**).

## Version 0.0.408 (June 10, 2026)
- **Roles, groups & quotas for not-yet-registered members** — admins can now assign RBAC roles, add to groups, and set a usage-policy (quota) on a *pending* invite (a user who hasn't signed up yet). These are stored against the invite and automatically materialized onto the user when they register, so access is correct on their very first request. Invites can also be pre-assigned at invite time (role/group/quota fields in the Invite modal), and removing a pending member cleans up its role/group/quota assignments.
- **Token-gated invites with expiry + resend** — invite links now carry a single-use token and expire after 14 days. On local/password sign-up the token is required: an invalid, expired, or missing token (for an invited email under closed signups) blocks account creation entirely. SSO/OIDC sign-up is unchanged (the IdP verifies identity, no token needed). A per-row **Resend** action (Members tab, requires `manage_members`) rotates the token, resets the 14-day window, and re-sends — the old link stops working immediately. Admins can also fetch a pending invite's link via an admin-only endpoint (handy when SMTP is off). Pending rows show an **Expired** status when the window lapses.
- **Reliable, human invite & welcome emails** — the invite email is now sent synchronously with retries + a per-attempt timeout (no more silent fire-and-forget), and the outcome (`sent` / `failed` / `skipped_no_smtp`) is surfaced to the admin. New users get a plain-text **welcome email** summarizing the agents (data sources) they can access with a link in. Copy is plain-text and human (no buttons), signed "BOW".
- **Members tab overhaul** — compact, cleaner table; checkbox selection with **bulk actions** (add role, add to group, remove); client-side **pagination**; row **Resend**; the **Actions column is frozen** to the right while the wide table scrolls; borderless inline Role/Quota selects; consistent role-name casing; collapsed group chips ("+N"); wider Note column with tooltip. The **Groups** and **Quotas** tabs now share the same compact styling.
- **Private data sources by default (#364)** — newly created data sources / agents are now private by default (`is_public = false`); only explicitly-added members (and admins) can see them unless opted public. Adding a member to a data source now sends a **delayed "you've been added" email** (5-minute delay, re-validated at send time so an undone add never mails, claimed so exactly one worker sends).
- **MCP search (#366)** — `search_mcps` supports wildcard queries (list everything) and ships a clearer tool description.

## Version 0.0.407 (June 9, 2026)
- Fix "Shared with me" reports linking to the owner's `/reports/:id` page (which renders blank for non-owners) — they now open the read-only shared conversation view at `/c/:token`. Shared reports without a share token are no longer clickable.

## Version 0.0.406 (June 9, 2026)
- SQL Server connections can now pass extra ODBC keywords (e.g. `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly` to route to a read-only Always On replica) via a new optional **Additional Connection Parameters** key-value editor in the connect form. Security-sensitive keys (Encrypt, credentials, driver, server, database) cannot be overridden, and existing connections are unchanged.

## Version 0.0.405 (June 9, 2026)
- QVD date/timestamp/time fields now load as real DATE/TIMESTAMP/TIME columns instead of raw Excel-style serial numbers, so they filter, sort, and group as dates

## Version 0.0.404 (June 8, 2026)
- Fix duplicate scheduled emails/reports under multi-worker/replica deployments — each cron fire is now claimed once via a DB-backed lock so exactly one worker runs it (also covers cache warmups, payload purge, and LDAP sync)
- License expiry now takes effect without a restart, plus a global expiry-countdown banner and a redesigned license settings page (tier/expiry details, expiring-soon and expired states, renew CTA)
- Small (<10 row) create_data results are no longer sent to Slack/Teams and are auto-collapsed in the report UI, since the agent's text already states the values
- Manage an agent's primary instruction from the agent page: edit, replace with an existing instruction, or start a training session
- Many-series (>8) line/bar/area charts now use a scrollable vertical legend docked on the right instead of an overflowing horizontal one
- Data-source and agent pickers grow to fit long names instead of truncating
- Fix report auto-title silently not saving (mostly on Postgres) when the background task outlived its DB session

## Version 0.0.403 (June 8, 2026)
- **Teams** — a reused Teams 1:1 conversation report (up to 5 days old) now re-syncs its data sources to the user's current access on each message, so grants appear and revocations disappear without waiting out the window.
- **UI** — the data-source members panel relabels the management column to "Management role" and the empty state to "Query only" (was "None"), and clarifies that everyone listed can query the agent and that Remove is what revokes access.

## Version 0.0.402 (June 8, 2026)
- Admin query-identity toggle for delegated (Entra ID / Microsoft Fabric OBO) connections — admins/owners can now choose, per connection, to run queries as the **service account** (the connection's principal) or as **themselves** (their own delegated/OBO token), from the connection detail modal. Default is "Me": the service principal is never used silently for an admin's interactive queries — if they have no personal token yet, the query is blocked and the UI prompts them to Connect. The selection is persisted per (user, connection) and applied consistently across the tables selector (overlay vs shared catalog), the agent's schema context, and query execution (inspect/create data).

## Version 0.0.401 (June 7, 2026)
- Agent run activity chart in /monitoring diagnosis — daily agent executions bucketed by status (success/error) with click-to-filter by day, backed by a new diagnosis timeseries endpoint
- Add a `bagofwords` MCP skill template documenting the core analysis workflow (create report, run tracked queries, build dashboards) for use with the BOW MCP connector
- MCP error handling: tool-level MCP failures (`isError`) now surface the server's real error message instead of `None`, so the agent can correct course instead of retrying blindly — and failed MCP calls no longer show a misleading green ✓ in the trace
- MCP planner context: the `execute_mcp` digest now echoes which underlying tool was called and with what arguments (plus the real error on failure), so the planner stops looping through call variants
- MCP tool UI: the tool card now shows the actual command/input invoked (tool + arguments for `execute_mcp`, query for `search_mcps`, code for `write_csv`), not just the result

## Version 0.0.400 (June 7, 2026)
- Teradata Vantage data source integration — connect Teradata as a data source, with sample queries included in the client description
- Generated-code reuse via `load_step`/`load_entity` — the planner and coder now prefer loading a prior step's results over rebuilding from scratch, reducing redundant code generation
- Fix LLM token-usage undercount in /monitoring (no added latency)

## Version 0.0.399 (June 7, 2026)
- Fix MCP tool results aborting the agent run: materializing a large/tabular MCP result to a file linked it to the report before the file's id was assigned, causing a foreign-key violation that poisoned the shared transaction (surfaced as "transaction is aborted" / agent execution errors). File linking now happens after the id is set and inside a savepoint, so a materialization failure degrades gracefully instead of failing the whole run. Also restores CSV preview generation, which was silently broken.

## Version 0.0.398 (June 6, 2026)
- Inbound webhooks for reports — connect GitHub, Jira, or any other service (Generic catch-all) so external events flow into a report's chat. Configure them from the report Summary tab; each report's webhook count shows in the reports list.
  - Per-webhook signing key with three verification modes: token header (default — a shared secret, works with Jira Cloud and most legacy systems), HMAC signatures (GitHub-native or BOW's own scheme), and URL token (for senders that can only POST). Per-org delivery dedup and rate limiting, plus a one-time URL + key reveal on create/rotate.
  - Optional small-model AI classifier decides whether an event warrants a response — guided by an optional per-webhook prompt plus your org instructions and the report's conversation — and, when it acts, authors the task the agent runs. The event entry shows a live 👀 (working) → ✅ (done) status; declined events are marked "no action needed".
  - Gated org-wide by the new "Report Webhooks" setting (on by default), with org limits for max webhooks and delivery rate.

## Version 0.0.396 (June 6, 2026)
- Star (favorite) reports — starred reports are pinned to the top of /reports. Starring is per-user, so each person keeps their own favorites, and you can star reports shared with you read-only

## Version 0.0.395 (June 6, 2026)
- Native web search for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI (provider-executed, via the Responses API) — opt-in per provider and gated by the org Web Fetch setting, with a live "Searching the web" step (rendered as a tool with the query + cited sources) and source citations

## Version 0.0.394 (June 6, 2026)
- Fix scheduled tasks running one weekday late (cron day-of-week off-by-one vs the scheduler), and the schedule editor showing the wrong day
- Conversation history now records scheduled-task and email actions (so the assistant can dedupe schedules, cancel the right task, and recall what it emailed)

## Version 0.0.393 (June 6, 2026)
- Scheduled tasks: ask the agent to run something on a recurring schedule (e.g. "email me once a week about ...") — new create/cancel scheduled-task tools, reusing the existing scheduled-prompt UI
