# ServiceNow Connector — Implementation Plan

Status: **planning only — no implementation yet**

Goal: add a first-class ServiceNow data source connector, in the same family as
PostgreSQL / Salesforce — admin connects an instance, the platform indexes its
schema, and the agent queries it at runtime.

---

## 1. How connectors work today (context)

A connector in bagofwords is four pieces, all registry-driven:

| Piece | Location | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Client | `backend/app/data_sources/clients/<type>_client.py` | Subclass of `DataSourceClient` (`base.py`): `test_connection`, `get_schemas`, `get_schema`, `execute_query`, `prompt_schema`, `description` |
| Config / credentials schemas | `backend/app/schemas/data_sources/configs.py` | Pydantic models with `ui:type` extras — the frontend renders forms from these automatically |
| Registry entry | `backend/app/schemas/data_source_registry.py` | `DataSourceRegistryEntry` keyed by type; declares title, auth variants, `client_path`, `data_shape`, `ui_form` |
| Icon | `frontend/public/data_sources_icons/<type>.png` | `DataSourceIcon.vue` falls back to `/data_sources_icons/{type}.png` by convention |

Because the admin form is generated from the Pydantic schemas and the client is
resolved via `resolve_client_class()`, **no bespoke frontend or API work is
needed** beyond the icon.

Closest reference implementations:
- `salesforce_client.py` — service connector with its own query language (SOQL), curated object list, schema via describe API.
- `posthog_client.py` — pure REST connector using `requests`, predefined schemas, structured error handling on `test_connection`. This is the best template for ServiceNow.

## 2. ServiceNow API surface (what we'll build on)

ServiceNow has no SQL endpoint. The relevant REST APIs:

- **Table API** — `GET /api/now/table/{table}` with:
  - `sysparm_query` — "encoded query" language (e.g. `active=true^priority=1^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on`)
  - `sysparm_fields`, `sysparm_limit`, `sysparm_offset`, `sysparm_display_value`
- **Aggregate API** — `GET /api/now/stats/{table}` for COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX with `sysparm_group_by`. (Phase 2)
- **Schema discovery** — query the Table API against ServiceNow's own metadata tables:
  - `sys_db_object` — list of tables (thousands; we will NOT enumerate all)
  - `sys_dictionary` — per-table field metadata: name, `internal_type`, and `reference` (the target table of reference fields → natural foreign keys for our `Table.fks`)
  - `sys_choice` — choice-list values (Phase 2, enriches the prompt schema)

**Auth options ServiceNow supports:** Basic auth (username/password), OAuth 2.0
(several grants), and API key (`x-sn-apikey`, newer releases).

**Dependencies:** none new. Use `requests` (already pinned in
`backend/pyproject.toml`), same as PostHog. The `pysnow` library is
unmaintained — plain REST is cleaner and matches the codebase style.

## 3. Design decisions

### 3.1 Query interface for the agent

The agent calls `client.execute_query(query)`. Salesforce passes a SOQL string,
PostHog a HogQL string. ServiceNow's native "language" is the encoded query,
which is table-scoped, so a bare string isn't enough — the table must ride
along.

**Decision: accept a JSON string spec**, documented in `system_prompt()`:

```json
{
  "table": "incident",
  "query": "active=true^priority=1^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on",
  "fields": ["number", "short_description", "priority", "state", "assigned_to"],
  "limit": 100
}
```

- Maps 1:1 to a Table API call; nothing to parse or translate.
- Encoded query syntax is heavily represented in LLM training data (it's what
  ServiceNow list filters copy to clipboard), so generation quality is good.
- `system_prompt()` documents the operators (`^` AND, `^OR`, `LIKE`,
  `ORDERBY`/`ORDERBYDESC`, `javascript:gs.daysAgo(n)` date helpers, dot-walking
  through reference fields e.g. `assigned_to.name`).
- Phase 2 adds optional `group_by` / `aggregations` keys routed to the
  Aggregate API.

Rejected alternatives: SQL→encoded-query translation (complex, lossy); raw
URL/params passthrough (no guardrails, worse prompting story).

### 3.2 Schema discovery

Full discovery is cheap in request count. The metadata lives in ordinary
tables queryable through the same Table API, so it's bulk dumps, not
one-call-per-table:

- **All tables (incl. custom):** `GET /api/now/table/sys_db_object` with
  `sysparm_fields=name,label,super_class,sys_scope` — a vanilla instance has
  ~3–5k rows; at the API's max page size of 10,000 that's 1 request.
- **All columns of all tables:** `GET /api/now/table/sys_dictionary` with
  `sysparm_query=internal_type!=collection` and slim `sysparm_fields` — tens
  of thousands of rows → roughly 3–10 paginated requests total.
- **Inheritance** (incident extends task, etc.) is resolved *in memory* by
  walking `sys_db_object.super_class` over the already-fetched dump — no
  extra queries.
- **Custom tables come for free**: `u_*` and scoped-app `x_*` tables and their
  fields are just rows in `sys_db_object`/`sys_dictionary` like everything
  else. Reference fields on custom tables give us their FKs too.

So a complete instance snapshot — every table, every field, every custom
field — is on the order of **5–15 HTTP requests**.

The real constraints are elsewhere:

1. **ACLs, not query count.** Out of the box only `admin` and
   `personalize_dictionary` can read `sys_dictionary`. Worse failure mode: a
   non-admin integration user gets **HTTP 200 with an empty result array**
   (while `X-Total-Count` still shows the real count) — schema discovery
   silently returns nothing instead of erroring. The client must detect this
   (empty dictionary rows for a table that exists ⇒ raise an actionable
   "grant metadata read access" error, checked in `test_connection`). Setup
   doc for admins: either grant `personalize_dictionary` (broad — includes
   write) or, better, a custom role with read ACLs on `sys_db_object`,
   `sys_dictionary`, `sys_glide_object` and their `.*` field ACLs.
   Fallbacks if metadata access is refused: the per-table Table Schema API
   (`/api/now/doc/table/schema/{table}`, also role-gated), or inferring
   field names from a sampled record (`sysparm_limit=1`,
   `sysparm_display_value=all`) — weak types, no FK targets, but never
   blocked.
2. **Noise, not volume.** Most of those 3–5k tables are platform internals
   (`sys_*`, `v_*`, `ts_*`, rollup/audit tables) that would pollute the
   catalog and the prompt schema. Discovery should filter to "business"
   tables: the `task` and `cmdb_ci` hierarchies, whitelisted standalone
   tables (`sys_user`, `sys_user_group`, `kb_knowledge`, …), plus anything
   `u_*`/`x_*` (custom = almost certainly business data).

**Decision: two discovery modes, both cheap.**

- **Default: curated table set + config override** (drives the demo
  experience, keeps the prompt schema tight).
- **`discover_all` config flag: bulk-dump discovery** per the above —
  business-table filter + custom tables, hierarchy-resolved in memory. This
  is what picks up customers' custom tables/fields without them typing a
  table list.

Default set (ITSM-centric, mirrors Salesforce's curated object list):

```
incident, change_request, problem, task,
sc_request, sc_req_item, sc_task,
sys_user, sys_user_group, cmdb_ci, kb_knowledge
```

- `ServiceNowConfig.tables` — optional comma-separated override/extension, same
  pattern as ClickHouse's `database` config field. For a curated list,
  `get_schemas()` still bulk-fetches: one `sys_dictionary` query with
  `nameIN <tables + their ancestors>` covers everything.
- `get_schema(table)` maps `sys_dictionary` rows: field name +
  `internal_type` → `TableColumn`; `reference` → populate `Table.fks` pointing
  at the referenced table (real FK info — better than most service connectors).
- `sys_id` is always the PK.

### 3.3 Auth

**Phase 1: Basic auth** (username/password of a service account with `rest_api`
/ read roles). This is `SalesforceCredentials`-level effort and covers the
majority of real deployments, which provision a dedicated integration user.

**Phase 2: OAuth 2.0.** The registry's `AuthOptions.by_auth` supports multiple
variants per type, so this is additive:
- `oauth_app` variant (client_id + client_secret + refresh token) for system
  scope.
- Per-user delegated OAuth — see §3.5; only if a customer needs per-user
  ServiceNow ACLs.

Optional cheap addition in phase 1 or 2: API-key variant (single `api_key`
field) since it's just a header swap.

### 3.5 Per-user access (ACLs) — do we need on-behalf-of?

**ServiceNow visibility is genuinely per-user.** Access control is
role-based table/field ACLs plus row-level restrictions (scripted ACLs,
query business rules) and, on MSP-style instances, domain separation. Two
users querying `incident` legitimately see different rows; HR (`sn_hr_core_*`)
and Security Incident tables are heavily row-scoped by design. The REST
Table API enforces ACLs **as the authenticated user**, and there is no
supported "run-as" / impersonation header for a service account — so
per-user fidelity requires per-user credentials of some kind.

The platform already has a graded ladder for exactly this, so nothing new
needs inventing:

1. **System service account (Phase 1 default).** Everyone shares the
   integration user's visibility — the same trust model as the Postgres
   connector. Correct when the connection is scoped to org-visible ITSM
   reporting and the service account is provisioned least-privilege.
   **Setup-doc warning:** don't grant the service account HR/SecOps/domain-
   separated tables unless everyone with access to the connection may see
   them; previews, indexing samples, and LLM-generated summaries run
   through this account.
2. **Per-user basic auth / API key — nearly free.** The registry's
   `AuthVariant.scopes` already supports `"user"`, backed by
   `UserConnectionCredentials` (per-user encrypted credential overlay on a
   connection). Declaring `scopes=["system", "user"]` on the userpass
   variant (as Salesforce does) lets each user store their own ServiceNow
   credentials — native ACL enforcement with zero new infra. Limitations:
   SSO-only users often have no local password (basic auth may be disabled
   for them); a per-user ServiceNow API key is the cleaner variant of the
   same idea.
3. **Per-user delegated OAuth (the real "OBO", Phase 2/3).** "Sign in with
   ServiceNow": admin registers an OAuth app in the instance's Application
   Registry; each user completes an authorization-code flow; queries run
   with that user's token so ACLs apply natively.
   `connection_oauth_service.get_oauth_params()` maps connection type →
   endpoints and already supports **per-connection** endpoints (the MCP
   path), which is what ServiceNow needs since its endpoints are
   instance-specific (`{instance_url}/oauth_auth.do`,
   `{instance_url}/oauth_token.do`) rather than fixed like Google/Microsoft.
   Token lifecycle (default ~30-min access tokens, ~100-day refresh tokens)
   is handled by the existing `maybe_refresh_oauth_credentials` machinery.
   Note: this is delegated auth per user, not Microsoft-style OBO token
   *exchange* — ServiceNow has no equivalent of `exchange_obo_token`; each
   user must complete the consent flow once.

**Catalog implication:** `catalog_ownership="shared"` remains correct. The
schema is (near-)identical for all users — ACLs filter *rows*, and only
occasionally hide fields — so discovery/indexing runs on the system
connection while queries may run on user credentials. This is the same
"admin catalog, ACL-filtered user overlay" shape as Postgres-with-RLS or
SharePoint, per the registry's own taxonomy.

**Recommendation:** ship Phase 1 with the service-account model but declare
`scopes=["system", "user"]` on the basic-auth variant from day one (it's
free and unlocks rung 2 immediately). Treat delegated OAuth as demand-driven
— it becomes a requirement the moment a customer wants HR/SecOps data or a
domain-separated instance connected.

### 3.4 Result semantics

- **Pagination**: loop `sysparm_offset` in pages of 1,000 (server default cap)
  up to the request's `limit` (default 100, hard cap ~10,000 rows) so a
  runaway query can't OOM the worker.
- **Display values**: `sysparm_display_value=true` by default — reference
  fields and choices come back human-readable ("Hardware" instead of a
  `sys_id`), which is what the agent and end user want. Exposed as a
  `ServiceNowConfig.display_values` boolean for admins who need raw values.
- **Errors**: mirror PostHog's `test_connection` — distinguish 401 (bad
  credentials), 403 (missing role/ACL), 404 (bad instance URL / table),
  429 (rate limited), with actionable messages.
- **Read-only**: the client only issues GETs. `capabilities = {Capability.QUERY}`
  (the base default). No write-back.

## 4. File-by-file work plan (Phase 1)

1. **`backend/app/schemas/data_sources/configs.py`**
   ```python
   class ServiceNowCredentials(BaseModel):
       username: str   # ui:type string
       password: str   # ui:type password

   class ServiceNowConfig(BaseModel):
       instance_url: str          # e.g. https://acme.service-now.com
       tables: Optional[str]      # comma-separated extra/override tables
       discover_all: bool = False # bulk-discover business + custom tables (§3.2)
       display_values: bool = True
   ```

2. **`backend/app/schemas/data_source_registry.py`**
   - Import the two schemas.
   - Add entry:
     ```python
     "servicenow": DataSourceRegistryEntry(
         type="servicenow",
         title="ServiceNow",
         description="Cloud platform for IT service management, operations, and workflows.",
         config_schema=ServiceNowConfig,
         credentials_auth=AuthOptions(default="userpass", by_auth={
             "userpass": AuthVariant(title="Username / Password",
                                     schema=ServiceNowCredentials,
                                     scopes=["system", "user"]),
         }),
         client_path="app.data_sources.clients.servicenow_client.ServiceNowClient",
         version="beta",
     ),
     ```
   - `client_path` must be **explicit**: dynamic resolution would derive
     `ServicenowClient` (lowercase n) from the type name, and the registry
     comments already flag the convention fallback as a bug source.
   - Defaults are correct as-is: `data_shape="tables"`,
     `catalog_ownership="shared"`, `ui_form="data_source"`.

3. **`backend/app/data_sources/clients/servicenow_client.py`** (~300–400 lines)
   - `ServiceNowClient(DataSourceClient)` with
     `__init__(self, instance_url, username, password, tables=None, display_values=True)`
     — constructor kwargs must match config+credentials field names, since
     `Connection.get_client()` merges both dicts into constructor params.
   - `connect()` contextmanager yielding a `requests.Session` with basic auth
     (PostHog pattern).
   - `test_connection()` — `GET /api/now/table/sys_user?sysparm_limit=1`,
     structured success/failure messages per §3.4.
   - `get_schemas()` / `get_schema(table)` — sys_dictionary + hierarchy walk,
     reference fields → fks.
   - `execute_query(query)` — parse JSON spec, call Table API, paginate,
     return `pd.DataFrame`.
   - `prompt_schema()` — `ServiceFormatter(self.get_schemas()).table_str`.
   - `system_prompt()` / `description` — encoded-query syntax guide with
     examples (the Salesforce client shows the shape; ServiceNow's needs to be
     meatier because encoded queries are less SQL-like than SOQL).

4. **`frontend/public/data_sources_icons/servicenow.png`** — brand icon;
   filename matches the type so `DataSourceIcon.vue`'s convention fallback
   picks it up with no code change.

5. **`backend/tests/unit/test_servicenow_client.py`** (mocked `requests`, in
   the style of `test_druid_client.py` / `test_qlik_sense_client.py`):
   - `test_connection` success / 401 / bad-URL paths
   - ACL silent-failure detection: sys_dictionary returns 200 + empty array
     for a table known to exist → actionable "grant metadata read" error (§3.2)
   - `get_schema` parses sys_dictionary incl. inherited fields and reference→fk
   - `discover_all` mode: business-table filter keeps `u_*`/`x_*`, drops `sys_*`
     internals; inheritance resolved from the in-memory `sys_db_object` dump
   - `execute_query`: valid JSON spec → correct URL/params; pagination across
     pages; limit cap; malformed spec → clear error
   - display_values on/off parameter propagation
   - Optionally register a live-instance smoke config in
     `backend/tests/integrations/ds_clients.py` (ServiceNow gives free
     Personal Developer Instances, so a real integration target is easy).

6. **`CHANGELOG.md`** — feature entry.

Nothing needed in the agent layer: `app/ai/agents/data_source/data_source.py`
(summary + conversation starters) works generically off any client.

## 5. Phasing

- **Phase 1 (MVP)** — everything in §4: basic auth, curated tables +
  sys_dictionary discovery, Table API JSON-spec queries with pagination,
  unit tests, icon, registry entry at `version="beta"`.
- **Phase 2** — Aggregate/Stats API for group-by queries; OAuth
  (`oauth_app` variant, maybe API key); `sys_choice` choice-list values in the
  prompt schema; promote to `version="1.0.0"`.
- **Phase 3 (as demand appears)** — per-user delegated OAuth ("Sign in with
  ServiceNow", §3.5) for ACL-faithful querying; knowledge-base articles as a
  document-shaped source; attachment retrieval.

## 6. Development & test environment (how to "simulate" ServiceNow)

ServiceNow is proprietary SaaS — there is **no official Docker image or
self-hosted option**, so unlike Postgres/MySQL it can never go in the
testcontainers registry in `tests/integrations/ds_clients.py`. The strategy
mirrors how the repo already handles SaaS-only sources (Snowflake, Power BI):

### 6.1 Personal Developer Instance (PDI) — the real thing, free

Sign up at <https://developer.servicenow.com> (free, personal email fine) →
"Request Instance" → latest release. You get a full instance at
`https://devXXXXXX.service-now.com` with an admin login and **demo data
preloaded** (incidents, users, groups, CMDB CIs, catalog items) — enough to
exercise every part of the connector immediately. It's the canonical dev
target because it lets us test the things a mock can't prove:

- real `sys_dictionary` / `sys_db_object` payloads and table hierarchies
- create `u_*` custom tables + custom fields → validate `discover_all` (§3.2)
- create a **non-admin integration user** → reproduce the 200-plus-empty-body
  metadata ACL failure (§3.2) and validate the least-privilege setup doc
- create restricted users → verify per-user row filtering (§3.5)
- register an OAuth app in the Application Registry → develop the delegated
  OAuth flow (§3.5) against real endpoints

Caveats: PDIs **hibernate** after inactivity (woken by logging in to the
developer portal) and are **reclaimed after ~10 days idle**. So the PDI is a
developer's tool and an on-demand integration target — not an always-on CI
dependency.

> **Validated 2026-07:** a PDI was provisioned and probed read-only from a
> cloud sandbox (via the outbound proxy): basic auth, bulk `sys_db_object` /
> `sys_dictionary` reads, and the Aggregate API all returned as designed, and
> the instance ships with demo data (67 incidents). One payload quirk
> confirmed for the fixture set: reference-type values come back as
> `{link, value}` objects, not scalars. Live-loop credentials are passed via
> `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL` / `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` env vars only — never
> committed (PDI instance names in a public repo invite credential stuffing).

### 6.2 Test tiers (matching repo conventions)

1. **Unit tests (CI, default)** — mock at the HTTP layer, no network, in the
   style of `test_druid_client.py` (fake plumbing) / `posthog`-type clients.
   Fixtures are **real JSON captured once from a PDI** and committed:
   `sys_db_object` page, `sys_dictionary` pages for the curated tables, an
   `incident` query result page, a multi-page pagination sequence, the
   empty-body ACL response, a 429. Capturing real payloads (rather than
   hand-writing them) is what makes the sysparm quirks — display_value
   variants, reference fields as `{value, display_value}` objects — show up
   in tests.
2. **Live integration tests (manual/optional)** — add `servicenow` to
   `tests/integrations/ds_clients.py` configured via env vars
   (`SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL` / `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD`) pointing at a PDI;
   skip when unset, like the other SaaS entries. Run locally before releases
   rather than in CI (hibernation makes PDIs flaky as a CI target).
3. **Optional e2e mock server (only if we want full-flow coverage)** — the
   repo already has precedent in `tests/mocks/mock_mcp_server.py` /
   `mock_oauth_provider.py`: a small FastAPI app emulating
   `/api/now/table/{table}` over the committed fixtures would let e2e tests
   drive connection-create → test → index → query without network. Nice to
   have, not required for Phase 1.

## 7. Appendix — creating the OAuth app in ServiceNow (Phase 2 setup)

Admin-side registration (one-time per instance, ~2 minutes; scriptable via
the Table API against the app-registry tables, so a PDI can be provisioned
automatically):

1. **All → System OAuth → Application Registry → New →**
   **"Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients"**.
2. Name `bagofwords`; copy the generated **Client ID** / **Client Secret**.
3. **Redirect URL**: `{bow_config.base_url}/api/connections/oauth/callback`
   (the existing shared callback in `routes/connection_oauth.py`).
4. Token lifespans: defaults (30-min access / 100-day refresh) are fine —
   refresh is handled by `maybe_refresh_oauth_credentials`.

Instance endpoints (standard, derived from `instance_url`):
`/oauth_auth.do` (authorize) and `/oauth_token.do` (token). PKCE: our flow
always sends a verifier; providers that don't support it ignore it.

bagofwords-side wiring when Phase 2 lands:
- Add an `oauth` AuthVariant (schema=`OAuthDelegatedCredentials`,
  `scopes=["user"]`) to the servicenow registry entry.
- Add a `servicenow` branch in `connection_oauth_service.get_oauth_params()`
  deriving both endpoints from the connection's `instance_url`, with
  client_id/secret from admin-entered connection credentials — same pattern
  as the existing MCP branch (which already proves per-connection endpoints).
- Client authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` instead of basic.

**System-scope alternative:** ServiceNow (Utah+) supports the OAuth
**client-credentials grant**, where the app-registry entry is bound to a
designated integration user and tokens are issued without user consent.
That's the cleanest implementation of the system-scope `oauth_app` variant —
no stored password, no refresh-token babysitting — and should be preferred
over a refresh-token flow when Phase 2 is implemented.

## 8. Open questions

1. **Default table set** — is ITSM (incident/change/problem/catalog) the right
   default, or do target users care more about CMDB or HRSD tables? (Config
   override makes this low-stakes, but the default drives the demo experience.)
2. **Auth priority** — is basic auth acceptable for the first customers, or is
   OAuth a hard requirement (some hardened instances disable basic auth)?
3. **Aggregate API in phase 1?** — "how many P1 incidents this month" style
   questions will otherwise pull raw rows and aggregate in pandas, which works
   but is wasteful on large tables.
